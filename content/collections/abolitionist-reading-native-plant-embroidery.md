title: Abolitionist Reading & Native Plant Embroidery
summary: "A time to read up on abolitionist futures while crafting together,
  followed by time for conversation. It is crucial that we focus our energy
  right now on the Black Lives Matter movement, on educating ourselves, on
  holding each other accountable, and building solidarity. For this reason,
  weâ€™ve decided to spend time together each Friday devoted to reading and
  crafting. "
