{{< donate placeholder="25" value="25" >}}

For 19 years, The Brooklyn Rail has provided New Yorkers with a free and independent forum to engage with the arts. Despite current instability and distance, we remain committed to making our journal freely available to readers each month.

The Rail also now hosts The New Social Environment: Lunchtime Conversations with The Brooklyn Rail, an online programming series. Each day at 1pm we gather as a community for conversations about creative life and artistic expression in our new reality.

Our journal and programming will remain free and independent. But as a small non-profit, we need your help. Please consider making a donation today: your contribution will directly support contributing writers, guest artists, and production staff in this unprecedented time.
