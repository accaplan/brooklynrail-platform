Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Brooklyn Rail has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Join us at 12pm ET**  for a live conversation over ZOOM with special guest  **Peter Brook**  and hosts  **Karen Brooks Hopkins**  and  **Bryan Doerries**  to discuss creative life in the context of our new social reality. This gathering will conclude with a poetry reading by a member of our staff.
