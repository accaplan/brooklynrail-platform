If smart contracts aren't contracts, what are they? Why can't you insure an NFT? What are you selling and what do you own? Is copyright applicable? Beyond the financial hype swirling around NFTs and the crypto-markets, there are practical considerations that artists and collectors need to take into account as a part of their participation. Partner and co-head of Art, Law and Emerging Technology at Cowan, DeBaets, Abrahams & Sheppard, LLC Sarah Odenkirk and Founder and Principal of Nomic Consulting Erika Knierim share their insights into the often confusing blockchain landscape with Rail Editor-at-Large Charlotte Kent, PhD.
