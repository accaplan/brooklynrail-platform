Our Plates for Change Annual Chef Showcase is back! After two years, we are thrilled to once again host our largest event of the year. Plates for Change celebrates the culinary excellence of over 30 local chefs, caterers, wineries, and breweries while supporting our critical work to fight hunger and poverty in Brooklyn.

All proceeds help [Neighbors Together](https://neighborstogether.org/) to provide daily meals, connections to stabilizing resources and leadership opportunities to over 10,000 individuals and families each year.

This is an **in-person** event at the Brooklyn Museum, Beaux-Arts Court, 200 Eastern Parkway. 

**Rest assured!** We will be observing COVID safety requirements in compliance with city, state, and federal guidelines. 21:30
