For 2022, Saas-Fee Summer Institute of Art has partnered with The Brooklyn Rail to present “Deep Ecology in the Cognitive Capitalocene,” an in-person program in Brooklyn, New York, alongside a free public lecture series held online.

A central feature of SFSIA is a Public Lecture Series, which is free and open to the public to invite conversation, debate, and inquiry across communities. This year the public lecture series will be held online in collaboration with The Brooklyn Rail.
