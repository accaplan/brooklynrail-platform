Award-winning *[Out of Exile – the Photography of Fred Stein](https://www.fredsteinmovie.com/)* is the tale of a man caught up in one of history’s darkest moments. The Nazi menace thrust [Fred Stein](http://www.rosenbergco.com/artists/fred-stein) into a life of exile: in 1930s Paris, across the war-torn French countryside, and in 1940s New York. Always full of belief in the human spirit, his answer was to create thousands of brilliant photographs, an art that transcends bigotry.
