Jonas Mekas’ feature length films speak to his mission of personal cinema. He believed that everyone could and should create a film.

"For two hours we stroll with Jonas Mekas through New York nights, through apartments, studios, backstage rooms, bars and clubs. We meet old acquaintances like Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Carolee Schneemann, Marina Abramovic, friends, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and also many new acquaintances. The father of the diary film begins with the words 'I can't sleep.' Who hasn't been in that situation. Sleepy and yet wide awake, you find yourself in the world of those exhausted from the day's exertions. In Sleepless Nights Stories we witness (approximately) 25 tales from a thousand and one nights - remnants of films by one of the greatest avant-garde filmmakers whose life rewrote film history" – Berlinale 2011
