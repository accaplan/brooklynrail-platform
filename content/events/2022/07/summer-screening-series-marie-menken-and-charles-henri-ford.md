"Made during the brief Christmas-lit season, usually between the hours of midnight and 1:00 AM, when
vehicle and foot traffic was light, over a period of three years. Based on store decorations, window
displays, fountains, public promenades, Park Avenue lights, building and church facades. I had to keep
my camera under my coat to warm it up, as the temperature was close to zero much of the time."                       - Marie Menken

*Glimpse of the Garden* directed by Marie Menken (1957), 16mm, Color, Sound, 24 minutes.

"A lyric, tender, intensely subjective exploration of a flower garden, with extreme magnification,
flashing color harmonies." - Cinema 16

*Poem Poster* directed by Charles Henri Ford (1967), 16mm, Color, Sound, 24 minutes.

"Probably filmed in 1966, with motif of an exhibition of Ford’s large-scale text-image collages, \[this] is
an invaluable historical document that shows Factory stars Edie Sedgwick and Gerard Malanga
cavorting with Beat legend William Burroughs, musician Ned Rorem, film critic Parker Tyler, literary
enfant terribles Frank O’Hara and Ted Berrigan, pop artists Jim Rosenquist and Andy Warhol, and
many fabulous unknowns. Jayne Mansfield makes a show-stopping appearance; this is probably one
of her last images. The soundtrack mixes free jazz (by John Handy), ambient sound, the voices of
gallery visitors, Charles Ford reading his own poetry, and a wry commentary by Al Hansen. It is a
collaborative enterprise, with camerawork by such luminaries as Marie Menken, Willard Maas,
Charles Boultenhouse, Gregory Markopoulos, Robert Whitman, Andy Warhol, Rudy Wirtschafter, and
Stan Vanderbeek. One can track the influence of almost all of them in the final mix, a luscious color
print rich in superimpositions, fish-eye views, and pixelations."  - Juan Suarez

**The New American Cinema Group / Film-Makers’ Cooperative** (NACG) was founded in 1961 for the
distribution of avant-garde film. It is the first artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art. Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as they are a non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership-based, non-profit group.\
