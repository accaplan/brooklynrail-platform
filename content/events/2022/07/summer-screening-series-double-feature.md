"Where is the light coming from? The flavor of the colors are succulent to the long vision in the soul.
How can dust cover the arrows of light? How can darkness favor oblivion in the face of light? The
variations of soul-touch exist in the auras of illumination. The Great Eye dominates."  -Storm de Hirsch

**The New American Cinema Group / Film-Makers’ Cooperative (NACG)** was founded in 1961 for the
distribution of avant-garde film. It is the first artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art. Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as they are a non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership-based, non-profit group.
