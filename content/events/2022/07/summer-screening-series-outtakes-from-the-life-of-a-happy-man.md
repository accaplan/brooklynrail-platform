"A motion picture composed of brief diaristic scenes not used in completed films from the years 1960 to
2000; and self-referential video footage taped during the editing. Brief glimpses of family, friends,
girlfriends, the city, seasons of the year, travels. Occasionally I talk, reminisce, or play music I taped
during those earlier years, plus more recent piano improvisations by Auguste Varkalis. It's a kind of
autobiographical, diaristic poem, a celebration of happiness and life. I consider myself a happy man."
-Jonas Mekas

**The New American Cinema Group / Film-Makers’ Cooperative** (NACG) was founded in 1961 for the
distribution of avant-garde film. It is the first artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art. Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as they are a non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership-based, non-profit group.
