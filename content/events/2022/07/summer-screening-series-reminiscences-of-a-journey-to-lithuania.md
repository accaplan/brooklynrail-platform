"The film consists of three parts. The first part is made up of footage I shot with my first Bolex, during
my first years in America, mostly from 1950 to 1953. It shows me and my brother Adolfas, how we
looked in those days: miscellaneous footage of immigrants in Brooklyn, picnicking, dancing, singing:
the streets of Williamsburg. The second part was shot in August 1971, in Lithuania. Almost all of the
footage comes from Semeniskiai, the village I was born in. You see the old house, my mother (born
1887), all the brothers, goofing, celebrating our homecoming. You don’t really see how Lithuania is
today: you see it only through the memories of a Displaced Person back home for the first time in 25
years. The third part begins with a parenthesis in Elmshorn, a suburb of Manburg, where we spent a
year in a forced labor camp during the war. After the parenthesis closes, we are in Vienna where we
see some of my best friends: Peter Kubelka, Hermann Nitsch, Annette Michelson, Ken Jacobs. The film
ends with the burning of the Vienna fruit market, August 1971. " - Jonas Mekas

**The New American Cinema Group / Film-Makers’ Cooperative** (NACG) was founded in 1961 for the
distribution of avant-garde film. It is the first artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art. Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as they are a non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership-based, non-profit group.
