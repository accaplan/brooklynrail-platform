Flux Factory together with [BIRUCHIY](https://www.instagram.com/biruchiy/) contemporary art project and [SPILKA NGO](https://www.instagram.com/spilka.nyc/) is hosting a fundraising event in support of the people of Ukraine affected by the full-scale Russian invasion. We invite you to learn about the Ukrainian art and music scene and how they are finding new meaning and urgency for their work in the face of genocide and war atrocities. Together, we will discuss how the international art community can work in solidarity with anti oppressive and anti colonial resistance. This is a special opportunity to engage with representatives of Ukrainian culture, learn about recent artworks of Ukrainian artists, listen and dance to electronic music by Ukrainian producers, and purchase some merch to support Ukraine. 

*All proceeds from the event will go to the [Charity foundation “East-SOS”](https://www.instagram.com/vostoksos_ua/) and other Ukrainian charities.*
