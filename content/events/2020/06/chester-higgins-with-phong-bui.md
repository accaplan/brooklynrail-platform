For the past five decades, artist **Chester Higgins** has been using his camera to search for the unseen — “that which is innate within all things and informs the appearance of our world.” “Unseen Spirit,” on view at Atlanta’s Arnika Dawkins Gallery through February 1, 2014, exhibits a selection of Higgins’s work from 1968 through 2012. Thirty-one black-and-white and five color photographs celebrate the photographer’s unique vision and feature images from North America, South America, and Africa.

Higgins’s work has culminated in exhibitions worldwide and in numerous books, including *Feeling the Spirit: Searching the World for the People of Africa* and his biography *Echo of the Spirit*. Currently he is researching and photographing monuments and other antiquity sites along the River Nile.
