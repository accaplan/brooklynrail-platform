      Joe Zucker (b. 1941, Chicago, Illinois, based in East Hampton, New York)
      has consistently been one of America’s most innovative artists. From the
      Seventies, Zucker experimented with what has become his signature
      technique: gluing cotton balls to canvas in a gridded arrangement and
      painting over them. Resulting in a highly textured surface reminiscent of
      mosaic, this technique radically transforms the surface of the canvas and
      challenges the “flatness.” His imagery most often relates in some way to
      the materials and processes, for example the series’ with cotton
      plantation imagery executed in cotton balls rolled in paint. Throughout
      his extensive career, Zucker has exhibited alongside artists such as Agnes
      Martin and Brice Marden at the pioneering Bykert Gallery in the 1960s, and
      later with dealer Holly Solomon, who was well known for her support of new
      and experimental mediums.


      Zucker’s work is in extensive public collections including: The Museum of Modern Art, New York, The National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Tel Aviv Museum, Israel, The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, The Brooklyn Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and many others.
