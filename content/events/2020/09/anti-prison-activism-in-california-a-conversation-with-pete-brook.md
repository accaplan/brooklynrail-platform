    event_bio: Pete Brook is a writer, curator and educator focused on prisons,
      photos, and power. In 2008, he founded the website Prison Photography to
      bring together research and writing that unpacks issues of procedure,
      visibility, distribution and art in imagery as it emerges from the U.S.
      prison system.  Pete has curated multiple exhibitions, including Prison
      Obscura (2014–2016) that brought together images about mass incarceration
      that were created outside of the documentary tradition.  Pete’s writing
      has been published by Aperture, The Atlantic, ICP, The Marshall Project,
      Time, Truthout, Wired and others. In 2018, Pete was awarded the W. Eugene

      James King is the State Campaigner for the Ella Baker Center for Human
      Rights. Prior to joining the organization, James worked to build
      recognition of the value of people who are being held in carceral spaces.
      In 2016, he organized a symposium at San Quentin, where he and other
      incarcerated students made specific policy recommendations concerning the
      implementation of Prop 57. In attendance were the Secretary of the
      California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, various officials
      from the California Governor’s office, numerous social justice advocates,
      and many of his incarcerated peers.


      James is also a writer and organizer, having written numerous op-eds, and a weekly blog that gave a first person perspective of the true impact of mass criminalization and living within the prison industrial complex. As an organizer, he founded a think tank of incarcerated people who were passionate about criminal justice policy and built relationships with multiple California criminal justice reform organizations.
