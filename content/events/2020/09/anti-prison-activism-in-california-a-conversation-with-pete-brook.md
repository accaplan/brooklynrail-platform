    event_bio: Pete Brook is a writer, curator and educator focused on prisons,
      photos, and power. In 2008, he founded the website Prison Photography to
      bring together research and writing that unpacks issues of procedure,
      visibility, distribution and art in imagery as it emerges from the U.S.
      prison system.  Pete has curated multiple exhibitions, including Prison
      Obscura (2014–2016) that brought together images about mass incarceration
      that were created outside of the documentary tradition.  Pete’s writing
      has been published by Aperture, The Atlantic, ICP, The Marshall Project,
      Time, Truthout, Wired and others. In 2018, Pete was awarded the W. Eugene
