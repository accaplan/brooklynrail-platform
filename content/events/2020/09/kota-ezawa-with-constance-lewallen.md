    event_bio: Ezawa was born in Germany, where he began his undergraduate studies
      at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf with Nam Jun Paik and Nan Hoover before
      relocating to the Bay Area. Kota Ezawa’s work explores the appropriation
      and mediation of current events and images, referencing sources from the
      news, art history, and popular culture. Since the debut of his 2002 video
      animation The Simpson Verdict, Ezawa has been well-known for creating
      light-boxes, videos, and works on paper that distill found images into his
      signature pared-down, flattened style. By reducing complex visual
      information to its most essential, two-dimensional elements, he explores
      the photographic record’s validity as a mediator of actual events and
      experiences
