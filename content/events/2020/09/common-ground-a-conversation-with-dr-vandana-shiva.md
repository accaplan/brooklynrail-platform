Please join us for the fourth installment of *Common Ground*, featuring a panel of prison activists in conversation with **Pete Brook**, writer and social justice curator behind *[Prison Photography](https://prisonphotography.org/)*, a curatorial project which analyzes the politics of visual culture and the American prison industrial complex.

We will close with a reading by poet **Mona Kareem**.
