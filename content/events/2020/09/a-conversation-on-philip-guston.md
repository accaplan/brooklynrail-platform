    event_bio: "Musa Mayer’s first book about her father, a memoir entitled ‘Night
      Studio’, was published in 1988 by Alfred A. Knopf and republished in a new
      edition in 2016 when Hauser & Wirth took over the representation of the
      Estate of Philip Guston from the McKee Gallery. Since Musa’s retirement
      from a twenty-five-year career as an acclaimed research and patient
      advocate for people living with advanced breast cancer, she has curated
      two exhibitions of Guston’s satirical Nixon drawings in New York and
      London, as well as a survey exhibition in Hong Kong. ‘Resilience’ is her
      third book with Hauser & Wirth Publishers. The second, ‘Philip Guston:
      Nixon Drawings 1971 and 1975,’ coauthored with Debra Bricker Balken, was
      awarded the FILAF d’Or international prize as the best international art
      book of 2017. Besides managing the Estate of Philip Guston, Musa is
      President of The Guston Foundation. Current Foundation projects include
      the website PhilipGuston.org, built around a Catalogue Raisonné of the
      paintings, and collaboration in the upcoming retrospective, ‘Philip Guston
      Now’, due to open in June 2020 at the National Gallery of Art in
      Washington, DC, that will travel to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston,
      the Tate Modern in London, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Musa
      lives in New York city, with her husband, Tom."
