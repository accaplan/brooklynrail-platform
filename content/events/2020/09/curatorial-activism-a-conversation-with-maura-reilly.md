    event_bio: "Maura Reilly is a curator based in New York who has written
      extensively on global contemporary art and curatorial practice, including,
      most recently Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating (Thames &
      Hudson, 2018). Reilly is the Founding Curator of the Elizabeth A. Sackler
      Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, where she developed and
      launched the first exhibition and public programming space in the USA
      devoted entirely to feminist art. While there, she organized several
      landmark exhibitions, including the permanent installation of Judy
      Chicago’s The Dinner Party, the blockbuster Global Feminisms (co-curated
      with Linda Nochlin), Ghada Amer: Love Had No End, among many others.
      Reilly has curated dozens of exhibitions internationally as an independent
      curator, with a specific focus on social justice. She is a founding member
      of two initiatives dedicated to fighting discrimination against women in
      the art world – The Feminist Art Project (TFAP) and Feminist Curators
      United (FcU). She received her M.A. and PhD in art history from the
      Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. She is an Editor-at-Large for
      the Brooklyn Rail. "

    event_bio: "Since the early 1990s, Patricia Cronin has been reflecting the world
      back at itself in her paintings, sculptures, and installations, asserting
      her own feminist, lesbian perspective, and unflinchingly critiquing
      gender, marriage, and political inequalities. Steeped in art history, and
      influenced by Philip Pearlstein and Lee Bontecou and the personal politics
      in the work of Joan Semmel and Carolee Schneemann, Cronin addresses
      lesbianism and female sexuality in her work. As she describes: “Besides
      reinvigorating traditional forms and injecting my specific contemporary
      political content, I think the main question all throughout my work—my
      career—has been: whose life has value? Whose body has value? And who
      decides?” Memorial to a Marriage (2002) exemplifies Cronin’s approach.
      Tender and daring, it is a gravestone showing herself and her partner,
      Deborah Kass, sleeping in loving embrace in bed—defiantly memorializing
      their illegalized love."
