      Wayne Thiebaud was born Mesa, Arizona in 1920, and his family soon moved
      to Los Angeles in 1921. In high school he became interested in stage
      design and lighting, and worked part-time at a movie theater where he made
      posters for lobby displays, 1935-1938. During this time he also worked as
      a summer apprentice program in the animation department of Walt Disney
      Studios, 1936. From 1942 to 1945, Thiebaud served in the Air Force,
      assigned to the Special Services Department as an artist and cartoonist,
      and eventually transferred to the First Air Force Motion Picture Unit,
      commanded by Ronald Reagan. It is not difficult to detect the influence
      that this commercial experience had on his later paintings attributed to
      Pop Art; Thiebaud's characteristic work displays consumer objects such as
      pies and cakes as they are seen in drug store windows. Thiebaud uses heavy
      pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects, and the
      well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always
      included. Objects are simplified into basic units but appear varied using
      seemingly minimal means. From 1949 to 1950, Thiebaud studied at the San
      Jose State University and from 1950 to 1953 at the California State
      University in Sacramento. He had his first solo exhibition at the Crocker
      Art Gallery in Sacramento, and between the years of 1954 and 1957, he
      produced eleven educational films for which he was awarded the Scholastic
      Art Prize in 1961. Thiebaud lectured at the Art Department of the
      Sacramento City College until 1959, when he became a professor at the
      University of California in Davis. Today, Wayne Thiebaud lives and works
      in California.
