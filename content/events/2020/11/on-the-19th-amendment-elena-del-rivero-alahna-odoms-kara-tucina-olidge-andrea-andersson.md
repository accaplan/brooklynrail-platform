Join us for a conversation with **Elena del Rivero**, **Alahna Odoms**, **Kara Tucina Olidge**, & **Andrea Andersson** on the storied history of the 19th Amendment and universal suffrage in this country — at the intersection of feminism, and in the wake of the recent presidential election and our changing Supreme Court.

#### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
