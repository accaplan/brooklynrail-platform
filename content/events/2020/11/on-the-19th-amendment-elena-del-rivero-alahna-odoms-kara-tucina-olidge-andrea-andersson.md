Please join us for the eleventh installment in our Common Ground series, for a conversation with visual artist **Elena del Rivero**, civil rights leader and Director of the ACLU of Louisiana **Alanah Odoms**, and scholar and Director of the [Amistad Research Center](https://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/) **Kara Tucina Olidge** in dialogue with **Andrea Andersson**, Director and Chief Curator of [Rivers Institute for Contemporary Art & Thought ](https://riversinstitute.org/)in New Orleans. They will be discussing the ongoing history of the 19th Amendment and universal suffrage in this country in the wake of the recent presidential election and our contested Supreme Court. 

Bringing together voices from the archive, visual art, and social activism, this hourlong conversation will kick off with a discussion of the nationwide art initiative *[Elena del Rivero: Home Address](https://riversinstitute.org/happenings/happenings-elena-del-rivero-home-address)* (Oct 2020–Feb 2021) to consider the local, national, and global implications of universal suffrage on the heels of one election and in anticipation of the Georgia Senate Runoff in January, as well as respond to the virtual exhibition* [Justice Can't Wait: Oppression and Resistance - Slavery to Mass Incarceration in Louisiana](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/justice-can-t-wait/IgJiVU_PJRY-LA)* co-curated by the Amistad Research Center and the ACLU of Louisiana. 

This conversation will be moderated by **Malvika Jolly**, and will close with a performance and recitation of "Register," a poem and sound composition by **Laura Mullen** and **Nathan Davis**, developed in collaboration with the Voting Rights Archives at the Amistad Research Center. 

#### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
