Please join us for a conversation on the [Oakland/Saint-Denis](https://www.oaklandsaintdenis.org/) project, featuring special guests **Juliette Donadieu**, cultural attaché of the French Embassy in San Francisco & director of [Villa San Francisco](https://www.villasanfrancisco.org/), **Simón Adinia Hanukai**, theatermaker & co-artistic director of [Kaimera Productions](https://www.kaimeraproductions.com/), **Lori Fogarty**, director of the [Oakland Museum of California](https://museumca.org/), and **Juliette Bompoint**, cultural producer & director of [Mains d'Oeuvres](https://www.mainsdoeuvres.org/?lang=fr), a nonprofit arts space in Saint-Ouen, a suburb of Paris. They will be joined by the *Rail*'s **Malvika Jolly** for a conversation on what our different cities can teach us, on reimagining the role of cultural actors in urban development, and why our cities must be built collectively. 

This dialogue builds on [Oakland/Saint-Denis](https://www.oaklandsaintdenis.org/), a cross-cultural collaboration between twenty artists, urban planners, entrepreneurs, cultural producers, and researchers from Oakland, CA and Saint-Denis, France—two unlikely cities where cultural and social innovation has historically flourished at the margins—to reimagine the future of our cities. We will also be celebrating the recent publication of their collaborative text *[Oakland/Saint-Denis: Translating Cities and Cultures](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec5d999509f0e0bb206c111/t/5f80e21c0f1813023b039164/1602282026779/oakland_stdenis_web_Publication2020.pdf)* which details their findings, roadmaps, and best practices for reclaiming cultural spaces, resisting real estate pressures, and creating new models for tomorrow's cities. 

We'll conclude with a poetry reading by **Farid Matuk**.
