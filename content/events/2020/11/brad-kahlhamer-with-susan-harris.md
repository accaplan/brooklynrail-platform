    event_bio: Brad Kahlhamer is an artist known for his multi-media practice,
      ranging from sculpture and painting to performance and music. He is
      currently based in New York City, working from his studio in Brooklyn.
      Major influences that appear throughout his work are informed by a
      lifetime of multi-ethnic and street culture explorations. Kahlhamer
      questions notions of authenticity and representation within a very
      specific discourse of Native American art. His work has been collected by
      institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of
      American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, the
      Milwaukee Art Museum, and the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Seattle
      Art Museum, the Hood Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern
      Art among others.
