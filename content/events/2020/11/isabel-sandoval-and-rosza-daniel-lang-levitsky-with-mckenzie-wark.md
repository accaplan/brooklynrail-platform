A conversation about the art and everyday cultures of trans women, past and present. How do we communicate with each other? How do we pass on what we learn to sisters to come? What are the arts of femininity that we borrow and invent? How does something like the trans feminine exist in different cultures and times and how those connections be understood without erasing differences? One day we might have comprehensive histories and theories about the art of the trans woman (broadly defined). This conversation brings together three scholars, artists and writers to share what they know, what we can learn and how to navigate some of the complexities of thinking and living the aesthetic dimension of our lives.
