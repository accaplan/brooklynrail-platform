    event_bio: "Jordan Casteel (b. 1989, Denver, CO) has rooted her practice in
      community engagement, painting from her own photographs of people she
      encounters. Posing her subjects within their natural environments, her
      nearly life-size portraits and cropped compositions chronicle personal
      observations of the human experience. Casteel received her BA from Agnes
      Scott College, Decatur, GA for Studio Art (2011) and her MFA in Painting
      and Printmaking from Yale School of Art, New Haven, CT (2014). Casteel's
      solo exhibition curated by Massimiliano Gioni, “Within Reach,” is
      currently on view at the New Museum, New York, presented in conjunction
      with a fully illustrated catalogue published by the New Museum. Recent
      solo exhibitions include “Jordan Casteel: Returning the Gaze,” presented
      at both the Denver Art Museum, CO (2019), and the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor
      Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University, CA (2019–20). In recent
      years, she has participated in exhibitions at institutional venues such as
      San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA (2020); Museum of Contemporary Art,
      Chicago, IL (2020); Kunsthal KAdE, Amersfoort, Netherlands (2020);
      Baltimore Museum of Art, MD (2019); Crystal Bridges Museum of American
      Art, Bentonville, AR (2018); MoCA Los Angeles, CA (2018); The Studio
      Museum in Harlem, NY (2017 and 2016); and MASS MoCA, North Adams, MA
      (2017). Casteel is an Assistant Professor of Painting in the Department of
      Arts, Culture, and Media at Rutgers University - Newark. The artist lives
      and works in New York."
