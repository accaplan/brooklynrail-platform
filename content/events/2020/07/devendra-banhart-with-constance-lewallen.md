    event_bio: "Constance Lewallen was born and raised in New York City. She is an
      adjunct curator at the University of California, Berkeley, Art Museum and
      Pacific Film Archive. In 1996 she curated Jay DeFeo: Selected Works
      1952-1989 for Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, which traveled to the
      UC Berkeley Art Museum. As senior curator at BAM she curated many major
      exhibitions including, most recently, A Rose Has No Teeth: Bruce Nauman in
      the 1960s, all of which were accompanied by catalogs and toured nationally
      and internationally. Her most recent exhibition was titled State of Mind:
      New California Art circa 1970, co-curated with Karen Moss. Her book on
      David Ireland’s house, published by UC Press, will be released when the
      house reopens."

    event_bio: Born in Texas, and raised by his mother in Venezuela until returning
      to California as a teenager, Devendra Banhart is admired for his
      shimmering, folk-inflected psychedelia. In a near two-decade career,
      Banhart has worked with Yoko Ono, Beck, and Caetano Veloso.  The
      self-described “very bad Buddhist,” and keen skateboarder, is also a
      visual artist and poet. His debut poetry collection, Weeping Gang Bliss
      Void Yab-Yum, was published in April 2019, and, like his songs, reflects a
      quirky, whimsical, at times melancholic sensibility. His most recent album
      is Ma, a collection of tender and elegant songs that speak to the Buddhist
      belief that everyone has been a mother at some point.
