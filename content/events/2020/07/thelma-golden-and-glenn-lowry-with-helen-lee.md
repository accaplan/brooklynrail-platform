      academic, art advisor, art book editor, and auction house specialist. She
      has worked at Christie’s, Harry N. Abrams Publishing, the Robert Miller

      communication across cultural and political divides. All art forms,
      whether through music, theater, dance, poetry, or literature, help us to
      make sense of the world and current events and can clarify how best to
      move forward. Helen is an advisor to the Milken Institute for its art and
      culture programming. She is the Chairman of the American Foundation for
