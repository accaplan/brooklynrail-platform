    event_bio: "Poet, art critic, and curator John Yau has published over 50 books
      of poetry, fiction, and art criticism. Born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1950
      to Chinese emigrants, Yau attended Bard College and earned an MFA from
      Brooklyn College in 1978. His first book of poetry, Crossing Canal Street,
      was published in 1976. Since then, he has won acclaim for his poetry’s
      attentiveness to visual culture and linguistic surface. In poems that
      frequently pun, trope, and play with the English language, Yau offers
      complicated, sometimes competing versions of the legacy of his dual
      heritages—as Chinese, American, poet, and artist. "

    event_bio: Simone White was born Middletown, Connecticut, and raised in
      Philadelphia. She earned her BA from Wesleyan University, JD from Harvard
      Law School, and MFA from the New School. White is the author of the
      full-length collection House Envy of All the World (2010) and the
      chapbooks Dolly (2008) and Unrest (2013). Her work has been praised for
      its innovative complexity, allusive song, and “lyric deconstruction of
      desire, entitlement, blackness, the domestic, language and diction,” in
      the words of Anna Moschovakis. White has received fellowships from Cave
      Canem and was selected as a New American Poet for the Poetry Society of
      America. She is completing a PhD in English at the CUNY Graduate Center
      and lives in Brooklyn, New York.
