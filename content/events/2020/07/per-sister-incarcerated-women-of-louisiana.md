    event_bio: Rontherin Ratliff is a mixed media sculptor whose work focuses on
      ideas of balance and the human condition. He blends functionality,
      aesthetic, context, and associations to address subjects of loneliness,
      loss, homesickness, memory, and the burdens we carry. Ratliff examines the
      metaphor of the body as a house where the mind dwells. Feeling at home or
      in harmony within including home as one's origin or domestic place. The
      work questions the sociocultural constructed concepts of self. With it, he
      contemplates reservations regarding home as a safe-haven where one
      experiences positive qualities such as security and comfort. Using
      architectural materials and domestic objects, his work explores the notion
      of internal versus external balance.

    event_bio: "In her words: \"You know, for a long time, women did not think that
      they had the right to own their bodies or to fight back or to make a fuss
      about something that's going on with them. And now women are fighting back
      from domestic violence or sexual assault or whatever it may be. And women
      are being criminalized because of that. I went to clemency hearings last
      week. And ten of the eleven women were domestic abuse survivors, and all
      ten of them were there serving life sentences for … standing up to their
      abuser.\""

    event_bio: "In her words: \"[The hardest issue was] being completely powerless
      over what happens with your children, if you left children – I left five.
      My three sons all were brutally shot. I had a daughter who had run away
      and… refused to let anyone take my place in her life… For me, that's the
      hardest piece of being imprisoned, if you're a parent. Every day I worried
      about my kids. Every single day, every day.\""

    event_bio: "Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick were born and raised in the
      lower ninth ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. As husband and wife team, they
      have been documenting Louisiana and its people for more than 25 years. In
      New Orleans, they have documented the music culture, which consists of
      Brass Bands, Jazz Funerals, Social and Pleasure Clubs, Benevolent
      Societies, and the Black Mardi Gras Indians. In addition to documenting
      New Orleans' social and cultural history, Calhoun and McCormick have also
      covered religious and spiritual ceremonies throughout their community, as
      well as river baptisms in rural Louisiana. They have created several
      photographic series, including Louisiana Laborers; The Dock Worker,
      Longshoreman, and Freight Handlers on the docks of New Orleans; Sugar Cane
      Field Scrappers in the river parishes along the Mississippi river; Cotton
      Gins, and Sweet Potato Workers in East Carrol parish of Lake Providence
      Louisiana. Calhoun and McCormick have documented the soul of New Orleans
      and a vanishing Louisiana: the last of the sugar cane workers, the
      dockworkers, the sweet potato harvesters, and the displacement of African
      Americans after Katrina. They photograph the traditions of black church
      services and religious rituals; community rites and celebrations, such as
      parades, and jazz funerals; and the cruel conditions of the Louisiana
      State Penitentiary at Angola, a former slave-breeding plantation named for
      the African nation from which “the most profitable” slaves, according to
      slave owners, were kidnapped."

The current Ford Foundation exhibition, ***[Per(Sister): Incarcerated Women of Louisiana](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/the-ford-foundation-center-for-social-justice/ford-foundation-gallery/exhibitions/per-sister-incarcerated-women-of-louisiana/)*** explores one of the most critical issues of inequality and injustice facing our nation today through the lens of a population too often overlooked. With an alarming rise in rates of female incarceration, this exhibition seeks to build awareness of the crucial issues that impact women before, during, and after incarceration. The exhibition presents works from more than 30 artists who created new pieces based on the personal stories of 30 formerly and currently incarcerated women: *persisters*. Stories of loss, hope, despair, survival, triumph, and persistence are shared in a variety of forms, demonstrating simultaneously the universal struggles faced by communities impacted by incarceration and the personal resilience of each woman featured.

***[Per(Sister)](https://www.persister.info)*** originated at the Newcomb Art Museum of Tulane University under the leadership of museum director Monica Ramirez-Montagut with assistance from Laura Blereau, and was developed in equal partnership with Syrita Steib and Dolfinette Martin with additional support provided by Operation Restoration and Women with a Vision.
