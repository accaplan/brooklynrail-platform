**Michael Joo** is a Korean-American artist best known for his scientific approach. Joo employs a variety of media, including sculpture, painting, photography, and printmaking, to reflect on identity, cultural heritage, and natural history. Joo’s non-linear, almost cyclical approach to his practice, together with his combination of scientific language and research, results in work that is a documentation of process. Whether chemically treated, silver-coated or photo-based, Joo’s artwork combines a range of techniques associated with sculp-ture, painting, photography and printmaking. He continues to blur the boundaries between art and science through his investigation into ontology, epistemology and entropy; creating a cross-disciplinary and multi-dimensional dialogue to engage, question, meditate and explore. By juxtaposing humanity’s various pools of knowledge and culture, Joo addresses the fluid nature of identity itself. It seems as if the artist’s intention is to achieve the unachievable: to make us see an object in real life that is barely conceivable as thought alone.He received his BFA from Washington University, St Louis, in 1989 and his MFA from the Yale School of Art, New Haven, 1991.
