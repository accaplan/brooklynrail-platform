  - person: kambui-olujimi-1
    event_bio: Kambui Olujimi was born and raised in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
      He received his MFA from Columbia University School of the Arts and is a
      graduate of Parson's School of Design and the Skowhegan School of Painting
      and Sculpture. Olujimi works within the realm of ideas rather than within
      an exclusive medium. Although he has directed a great deal of work in
      film, his is truly a multi-media practice. He crafts potent social
      commentary from delicate wisps of myth and whimsy mixed with real-world
      narrative. Lyrical and elliptical rather than ideological, Olujimiâ€™s art
      transcends the political sphere, affirming its own autonomy.
