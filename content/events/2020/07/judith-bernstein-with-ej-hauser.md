    event_bio: "Since graduating from Yale in 1967, Judith Bernstein has developed a
      reputation as one of the most unwaveringly provocative artists of her
      generation. Steadfast in her cultural, political and social critique for
      over 50 years, Bernstein surged into art world prominence in the early
      1970s with her monumental charcoal drawings of penis-screw hybrids; early
      incarnations of which were exhibited at AIR Gallery; Brooks Jackson Iolas
      Gallery, New York; Brooklyn Museum; and MoMA P.S. 1, among other
      institutions. "

    event_bio: EJ Hauser’s painting practice is deliberately multifaceted, an
      aggregate of multiple threads and conversations. Discrete bodies of work
      coalesce to form a larger project, with subsets including text-based
      works, figurative painting, abstract painting, and conceptual approaches
      to color. Hauser approaches paintings first by establishing an armature
      and then building up and out from this initial structure. These early
      forms diverge and challenge singular readings of painting, canonical
      notions of "signature" practices, and gender identity as it relates to
      painting and art-making. Hauser’s work has been shown at The Journal
      Gallery, Regina Rex, NURTUREart, James Fuentes, and Never Work Gallery,
      all in New York City, among others
