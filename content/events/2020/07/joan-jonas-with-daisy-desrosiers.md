    event_bio: Immersed in the 1960s downtown New York art scene, Joan Jonas studied
      with the choreographer Trisha Brown for two years and was influenced by
      the work of John Cage and Claes Oldenburg. Adopting the idea of
      art-as-process, she turned from painting and sculpture to performance art,
      exploring different aspects of how live events could be structured in time
      and space. In the early 70s, her work became increasingly symbolic,
      gamelike, and ritualistic. By the 80s, she began to create complex,
      nonlinear narratives premised on literary and historical texts, including
      science-fiction, medieval Icelandic sagas, and, more recently, the
      writings and biography of the art historian Aby Warburg. Her most recent
      work explores the relationship between new digital media and performance
      in multichannel video installations.
