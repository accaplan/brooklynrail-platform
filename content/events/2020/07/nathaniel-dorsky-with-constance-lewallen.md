    event_bio: "Nathaniel Dorsky is an experimental filmmaker and film editor who
      has been making films since 1963. “The films of Nathaniel Dorsky blend a
      beauteous celebration of the sensual world with a deep sense of
      introspection and solitude. They are occasions for reflection and
      meditation, on light, landscape, time, and the motions of consciousness.
      Their luminous photography emphasizes the elemental frisson between
      solidity and luminosity, between spirit and matter, while his uniquely
      developed montage permits a fluid and flowing experience of time. Dorsky’s
      films reveal the mystery behind everyday existence, providing intimations
      of eternity.“ - Steve Polta, San Francisco Cinematheque. "
