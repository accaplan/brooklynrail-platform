Born in 1930 in Chicago, Ron Gorchov studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1948-1950 and at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign from 1950-1951. Tibor de Nagy Gallery gave the artist his first solo exhibition in 1960, and after a brief hiaitus from the art world, Gorchov completed his first “saddle” paintings in 1967, the artist's signature curved canvases that he would pursue in countless variations for the next fifty years. His work was selected for the 1975 and 1977 Whitney Biennials, and went on to be included in multiple exhibitions at the the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the New Museum.
