      Since the late 1960s, Robert Wilson's productions have decisively shaped
      the look of theater and opera. Through his signature use of light, his
      investigations into the structure of a simple movement, and the classical
      rigor of his scenic and furniture design, Wilson has continuously
      articulated the force and originality of his vision. Wilson's close ties
      and collaborations with leading artists, writers, and musicians continue
      to fascinate audiences worldwide.


      Wilson founded The Watermill Center in 1992 on the site of a former Western Union communication research facility near Southampton, Long Island, about two hours from New York City. Watermill fosters research in the arts of the stage, providing young and emerging artists with a unique environment for creation and exploration in theater and all its related art forms, and developing a strong global network transcending age, experience, social, religious and cultural backgrounds.  Watermill supports projects that integrate different genres and art forms, break with traditional forms of representation, and develop democratic and cross-cultural approaches. Watermill is about living and working together, and creating your own environment and sharing this experience with others.
