    event_bio: "Over the past decade, Raha Raissnia's paintings, drawings, and films
      have unfolded within a permutational, self- reflexive structure. In her
      earlier work, the artist presented dense, architectonic black and white
      drawings and paintings that appeared to echo a certain postwar European
      abstraction. Rather than deferring to gesture, however, Raissnia
      orchestrated these scapes by steadily tracing a configuration of
      intersecting and overlapping vectors in space. In her self-titled
      exhibition at the gallery in 2009, a hybrid 16mm film and 35mm slide
      projection occupying one wall provided a glimpse into the expanded cinema
      practice that informs the artist’s two-dimensional work. The artist’s
      films, drawings, and paintings are closely imbricated: paintings are
      contrapuntal compositions catalyzed by film stills, transferred faintly
      onto the surface of the panel and elaborated upon with oil and gesso. Her
      films echo this archaeological process, constructed from fragments of
      earlier work and structured as overlapping pairs of 35mm slide and 16mm
      film projections. Raissnia’s drawings and collages, likewise comprised of
      image transfers, with Sumi ink and compressed charcoal, examine this
      relationship of mutual influence. All are guided by the materiality of
      their media."
