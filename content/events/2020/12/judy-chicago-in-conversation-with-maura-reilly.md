    event_bio: "Judy Chicago (b. 1939, Chicago) is an artist, author, feminist, and
      educator whose career spans almost six decades. Since 1996, she has lived
      in Belen, New Mexico, where her nonprofit arts organization, Through The
      Flower, is headquartered and where an art space and resource center has
      been established. Recent exhibitions include Judy Chicago: A Reckoning,
      ICA Miami, Miami, FL (2018-2019); Roots of The Dinner Party: History in
      the Making, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY (2018); and Inside the Dinner
      Party Studio, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.
      (2017-2018). In the fall of 2019, Judy Chicago: Los Angeles was presented
      at Jeffrey Deitch’s Los Angeles Gallery, and an exhibition of her Dior
      Banners (from the January 2020 Couture show in Paris) are presently on
      display at Jeffrey Deitch, New York, along with the artist's studies and a
      special exhibition of her Lady Dior purses. In July 2021, Thames & Hudson
      will publish The Flowering: The Autobiography of Judy Chicago with an
      introduction by Gloria Steinem. A retrospective survey of Judy Chicago’s
      work will be held at the De Young Museum in San Francisco in August 2021
      which will be accompanied by an extensive exhibition catalogue. Recently,
      her fireworks archive has been acquired by the Nevada Museum of Art, home
      to a large Land art archive, and a year-long exhibition will open there in
      October 2021. Her print archive was acquired this year by the Jordan
      Schnitzer Foundation, which will organize a touring exhibition and publish
      a catalogue raisonné of her prints with an interview by Hans Ulrich
      Obrist. "
