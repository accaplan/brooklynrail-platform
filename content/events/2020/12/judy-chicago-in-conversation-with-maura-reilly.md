      almost six decades. Since 1996, she has lived in Belen, New Mexico, where
      her nonprofit arts organization, Through The Flower, is headquartered and

      Recent exhibitions include  _Judy Chicago: A Reckoning_, ICA Miami, Miami, FL (2018-2019);  _Roots of The Dinner Party: History in the Making_, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY (2018); and  _Inside the Dinner Party Studio_, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.

In the fall of 2019,  _Judy Chicago: Los Angeles_  was presented at Jeffrey Deitch’s Los Angeles Gallery, and an exhibition of her Dior Banners (from the January 2020 Couture show in Paris) are presently on display at Jeffrey Deitch, New York, along with the artist's studies and a special exhibition of her Lady Dior purses. In July 2021, Thames & Hudson will publish  _The Flowering: The Autobiography of Judy Chicago_  with an introduction by Gloria Steinem. 


      A retrospective survey of Judy Chicago’s work will be held at the De Young Museum in San Francisco in August 2021 which will be accompanied by an extensive exhibition catalogue. Recently, her fireworks archive has been acquired by the Nevada Museum of Art, home to a large Land art archive, and a year-long exhibition will open there in October 2021. Her print archive was acquired this year by the Jordan Schnitzer Foundation, which will organize a touring exhibition and publish a catalogue raisonné of her prints with an interview by Hans Ulrich Obrist.
