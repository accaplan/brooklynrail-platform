      Camille Morineau is a curator based in Paris. She has worked for French
      public institutions for over twenty years, including at the Centre Georges
      Pompidou as curator of the contemporary collections, where she curated
      many exhibitions, most notably, _elles@centrepompidou_ (2009-2011), which
      was a reinstallation of the museum’s permanent collection with works only
      by women. Other notable exhibitions include the 2018 retrospective of Kiki
      Smith at the Monnaie de Paris, where she served as Director of Exhibitions
      and Collections from 2016-19, the 2014 Niki de Saint Phalle retrospective
      at the Grand Palais in Paris and Guggenheim Bilbao, and _Women House_, a
      group exhibition in conversation with the famous project _Womanhouse_,
      developed in 1972 by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, which premiered at
      the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. in 2018.
      Morineau is the co-founder and director of AWARE, an art historical
      non-profit devoted to recognizing significant women artists of the 20th
      century. In 2020 she was awarded the most prestigious award in France, the
      Chevalière de la Légion d’honneur, which recognizes citizens who have made
      extraordinary contributions to France.
