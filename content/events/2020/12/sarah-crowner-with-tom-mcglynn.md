summary: Sarah Crowner with Tom McGlynn

  - person: sarah-crowner
    event_bio: "Sarah Crowner was born in Philadelphia in 1974. She earned a BA from
      the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1996, and an MFA from Hunter
      College, City University of New York, in 2002. In her search for a mode of
      image making that accommodates immediacy and spontaneity, Crowner creates
      graphic compositions that discretely test the boundaries of abstract
      painting while also engaging and reshaping its art historical legacy. From
      afar, the bold geometric forms, clean lines, and elegant arabesques
      inhabiting her canvases conjure the pristine visual fields of geometric
      abstraction. On closer viewing, the presence of stitches and seams reveals
      a craft-oriented methodology in which raw and painted segments of canvas
      are cut, rearranged, and sewn together using the process-based logic of
      collage. "
