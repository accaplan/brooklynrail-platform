    event_bio: "Alexander Nagel is Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. His
      interest in art and religious reform produced Michelangelo and the Reform
      of Art (2000, winner of the Renaissance Society of America’s Gordan book
      prize), and The Controversy of Renaissance Art (2011, winner of the
      College Art Association’s Morey book prize). His interest in the multiple
      temporalities of art led to the publication of Anachronic Renaissance
      (co-authored with Christopher Wood, 2010) and Medieval Modern: Art out of
      Time (2012). His current work addresses questions of orientation and
      configurations of place in Renaissance art and culture. In 2016, he
      received an NEH Fellowship for a collaborative project (with Elizabeth
      Horodowich, NMSU) entitled Amerasia: A Renaissance Discovery."
