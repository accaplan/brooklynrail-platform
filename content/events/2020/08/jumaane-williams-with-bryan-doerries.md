    event_bio: "Bryan Doerries is a writer, director, and translator, who currently
      serves as Artistic Director of Theater of War Productions. A
      self-described evangelist for ancient stories and their relevance to our
      lives today, Doerries uses age-old approaches to help individuals and
      communities heal from trauma and loss. During his tenure at Theater of War
      Productions, the company has presented diverse projects across the United
      States and internationally. The company uses dramatic readings of seminal
      plays and community conversations to confront topics such as
      combat-related psychological injury, end-of-life care, police and
      community relations, prison reform, gun violence, domestic violence,
      sexual assault, the refugee crisis, and addiction. Doerries’ books include
      The Theater of War: What Ancient Greek Tragedies Can Teach Us Today, The
      Odyssey of Sergeant Jack Brennan, and a collection of his translations of
      ancient Greek Tragedies entitled All That You’ve Seen Here is God. Among
      his awards, he has received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from
      Kenyon College, and in March 2017, he was named Public Artist in Residence
      (PAIR) for the City of New York, a joint appointment with the New York
      City Department of Veterans’ Services and Department of Cultural Affairs."
