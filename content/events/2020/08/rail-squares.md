**Januario Jano** is a multi-disciplinary artist who lives and works between London, Luanda, and Lisbon. Reflecting on the ideas of home and self, he explores historical and contemporary narratives within the globalization context. It is seduced in the parallel between fiction and reality, the increased concern about the ecological relationship between humans, nature, and non-humans, that creates the intersection to engage with the complex themes around space and time. The body is pivotal, and its representation occurs within the increasingly globalized and cross-cultural dimension, which facilitates his engagement with sculpture, installations, and performance.

**Peter Spanjer** lives and works in London. His work has a layer of sensuality, sexuality, and a certain softness and vulnerability which can be traced to his personal battles with breaking away from gender identification within an African household, specifically as a black gay male. Spanjer strives to confront his own sensitivity in his work. The research is often based on self-evaluation: trying to dismantle narratives that have been planted and may still be growing. Whilst challenging an internalized belief system, Spanjer equally tries to pull apart generic ideas on ‘blackness’ and black men within the art world and what an artist who is black should display or talk about within their work. The theme of resistance is often a framework he tries to build or begin to build a workaround.

**Lydia Pettit**'s works are confrontational depictions of her own inward gaze, forcing the viewer to reckon with the realities of her body and mind, and their own viewpoints on the struggles women face with sexual abuse, trauma, body politics, and mental health. Her materials range from large expressive oil paintings of her body to intimate, hyper-real figurative embroideries within odd quilts to create new realities spanning painting and textiles. Pettit’s paintings explore the experience of PTSD and the politics of the body, using her own image as a vehicle to process and communicate. Her textile pieces capture this eerie experience using disjointed compositions and mixed materials, disembodied figures, and contrast between representational embroideries and cartoonish environments.

Her writing appears regularly in art and design publications including Flash Art, Frieze, Kaleidoscope, Mousse, and The Architectural Review.
