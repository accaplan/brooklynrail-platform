    event_bio: Andrei Codrescu was born in Transylvania, Romania, reborn at the age
      of 19 in Detroit and New York in 1967-1970. A professional nomad he has
      lived in San Francisco, Monte Rio California on the Russian River,
      Baltimore, Baton Rouge and New Orleans. He is the recipient of 40,000
      angry letters from Ralph Reed’s “silent majority” for urging
      Christian  believers in the “Rapture” to ascend to Heaven  as quickly as
      the Lord will make room for them. He did this on NPR, which as we know, is
      the radio station all evangelicals listen to – religiously. Codrescu’s
      first book of poetry was “License to Carry a Gun” in 1970, and his most
      recent, “The Art of Forgetting” (2019) He writes novels and essays and won
      the Peabody award for the film “Road Scholar.”
