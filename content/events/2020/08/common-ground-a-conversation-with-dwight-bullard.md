      State Senator Dwight M. Bullard hails from an esteemed educator, community
      activist and legislator family. From 2000 to 2017, Sen. Bullard was a
      teacher at Coral Reef Senior High School and in 2008 he was sworn into
      office as representative of District 118 and was reelected subsequently.
      He served as a member of the Agriculture & Natural resources policy
      committee, the Prek-12 appropriations committee, Prek-12 education policy
      committee and several others. In 2012 Senator Bullard was elected to the
      Florida Senate where he served as Vice Chair of the Transportation and
      Agriculture committees and maintained membership on Education and several
      other committees. In his time in the Senate, Bullard worked to stop online
      bullying, bring tuition equity to aspiring citizens and raise the minimum
      wage. Bullard served in the Florida Senate until 2016. His extensive and
      remarkable role in political and educational leadership has granted him
      tremendous recognition and awards.


      In 2017 Bullard was hired as the Political Director of the New Florida Majority. In this capacity he works to bring political education and awareness to underserved and often marginalized communities. He also works to push policy to positively impact those same communities. His work now much like his previous roles looks to uplift people in a way that makes them the masters of their own destiny. He continues to simply amplify the voice of those often unheard.
