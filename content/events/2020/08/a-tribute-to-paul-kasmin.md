    event_bio: Elliott Puckette’s delicate and ethereal paintings are a continual
      exploration of the dynamic possibilities of the line. Evocative of written
      music and ancient script, her linear abstraction is rendered either by
      etching into the prepared ground with a razor blade or drawing
      meticulously with ink on an expanse of paper. Puckette received her BFA
      from Cooper Union in New York in 1989. Her works are included in the
      permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York
      Public Library, the Fogg Museum, and the Huntsville Museum of Art. She has
      been represented by Kasmin since 1993. Elliott was born in Lexington,
      Kentucky, and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.
