    event_bio: "Tony Oursler is an American multimedia and installation artist.
      Always rooted in the medium of film, Tony Oursler conjures sculptural and
      immersive experiences using technologies that hark back to magic lanterns,
      Victorian light shows, camera obscura and auratic parlor tricks, but that
      also look forward to the fully networked, digitally assisted future of
      image and identity production. As a pioneer of video art in the early
      1980s New York, Oursler specialized in hallucinogenic dramaturgy and
      radical formal experimentation, employing animation, montage and
      live-action: “My early idea of what could be art for my generation was an
      exploded TV”. From performative and low-fi beginnings, Oursler has
      developed ever-evolving multimedia and audio-visual practice utilizing
      projections, video screens, sculptures, and optical devices, which might
      take form as figurative puppets, ethereal talking automatons or immersive,
      cacophonous environments. His enduring fascination for the conjunctions
      between the diametrically opposed worlds of science and spiritualism has
      allowed him to explore all kinds of occult and mystical phenomena. Tony
      Oursler lives and works in New York."
