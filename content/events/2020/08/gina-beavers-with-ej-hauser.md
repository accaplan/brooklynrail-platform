    event_bio: EJ Hauser is a painter who lives and works in Brooklyn, and is
      represented by Derek Eller Gallery in New York and Philipp Haverkampf
      Gallery in Berlin. EJ’s paintings are both graphic and open to
      interpretation, teetering between iconography and something familiar but
      abstract. This imagery shifts between omnivorous references both ancient
      and current, her paintings are mysterious talisman, employing buzzing
      pallets and marks that dance. Stuttering lines form a visual code like
      musical notes, which coalesce with atmospheric layers to create ineffable
      messages. Her paintings and drawings have been shown in numerous group
      exhibitions in New York, including Cheim & Read, Sperone Westwater, Gavin
      Brown’s Enterprise, Regina Rex, The Journal, and Sargent’s Daughter’s. Her
      work has been featured in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Frieze,
      Turps Banana, and The Brooklyn Rail, among others. EJ is currently an
      Adjunct Assistant Professor of Visual Arts at Columbia University in the
      Graduate Department.
