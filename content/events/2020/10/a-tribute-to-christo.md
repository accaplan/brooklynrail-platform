      Barbara Rose is an American art historian and critic who has published
      widely in the field of modern American art. Born in 1938 in Washington,
      DC, Rose studied at the Sorbonne, Smith College, Barnard, and finally,
      Columbia University under Meyer Shapiro. Rose became immersed in the New
      York-based circle of modernist artists and curators in the late 1950s and
      early 1960s, and made her substantial contribution to the discourse on
      contemporary art with the insider's perspective this afforded her.


      Rose taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence, University of California at Irvine and San Diego, and the American University Art in Italy program, and was senior curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, from 1981-1985. A prolific writer, Rose is the author of American Art Since 1900(1967), The Golden Age of Dutch Painting (1969), American Painting: The 20th Century (Skira, 1969), and monographs on the artists Magdalena Abankawicz, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Rauschenberg, Alexander Liberman, Larry Rivers, and others, as well as dozens of exhibition catalog essays. She held editorial positions at Art in America, Vogue, Artforum, Partisan Review, and Journal of Art, and her writing has also appeared in Art International, Studio International, Arts Magazine, and ARTnews, among many others.
