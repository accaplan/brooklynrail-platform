# **THANK YOU**

# **CLOSING THOUGHTS & SIGNS OF CHANGE**

*From Art in General*

> After careful deliberation and long discussions over the past six months, the Board of Directors and the Executive Director have arrived at the difficult decision to close Art in General, upon reaching the milestone of our 40th anniversary. Although we have taken critical measures to adjust to the new normal, the financial constriction due to the COVID-19 pandemic has proved formidable, severely affecting our ability to fulfill our mission of presenting new work by emerging and mid-career artists to the New York area.
>
> Since 1981, [Art in General](http://www.artingeneral.org) has proudly shown over 2,000 artists who have gone onto greater success, including Dorothea Rockburne, Joan Jonas, Kay WalkingStick, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Glenn Ligon, Byron Kim, Elizabeth Peyton, Marina Abramovic, Gabriel Orozco, Paul Pfeiffer, William Pope.L, Pipilotti Rist, Francis Alys, Walid Raad, Sharon Hayes, Patty Chang, Allora & Calzadilla, Pierre Huyghe, among many others. Our roster of artists reflects our deep and long-standing commitment to diversity and equity in the arts. To secure this legacy, we have donated our archives to the **[Smithsonian Archives of American Art](https://www.aaa.si.edu/)**, where students and scholars may find materials about our past programs, as well as founding documents and the entirety of Holly Block’s papers during her 18-year tenure as Art in General’s pioneering first director. To complement the papers at the Smithsonian, we also donated a complete set of publications by Art in General to **[New York University Special Collections — Fales Library, Downtown Collection](https://guides.nyu.edu/downtown-collection)**. Our remaining inventory of books and printed materials were gifted to **[Art Resources Transfer](https://www.artresourcestransfer.org/)**, a nonprofit organization committed to the egalitarian access to the arts and literacy. Through their Distribution to Underserved Communities Library Program, A.R.T. will disperse Art in General’s publications free-of-charge to rural and inner-city public libraries, schools, prisons, and alternative education centers nationwide.

> We are proud to present our last New Commission, ***[Project 270: Signs of Change](http://www.artingeneral.org/exhibitions/706)*** and online exhibition ***[Dropped By and Found You: #DroppedByAiG](http://www.artingeneral.org/exhibitions/704)***.
