Please join us for our eighth installment of *Common Ground*, when we will be joined by **Katherine Stewart**, investigative reporter and author of *[The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism ](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-power-worshippers-9781635573435/)*(Bloomsbury, 2020) in conversation with artist **Jamie Nares** for a dialogue on the Religious Right's rise to political power, how its ascent to the White House was paved by a massive political network of think tanks, advocacy groups, legal initiatives, and evangelical organizations funded by a handful of super-wealthy, ultraconservative donors and family foundations, and how this homegrown wave of religious fundamentalism masquerading as a "social movement" for religious protections constitutes a graver threat to the American republic than we may realize.

### **On this series** 

At the start of quarantine, the Brooklyn Rail asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
