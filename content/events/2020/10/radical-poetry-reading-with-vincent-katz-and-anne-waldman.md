      angry letters from Ralph Reed’s “silent majority” for urging
      Christian  believers in the “Rapture” to ascend to Heaven  as quickly as
      the Lord will make room for them. He did this on NPR, which as we know, is
      the radio station all evangelicals listen to – religiously. Codrescu’s
      first book of poetry was “License to Carry a Gun” in 1970, and his most
      recent, “The Art of Forgetting” (2019) He writes novels and essays and won
