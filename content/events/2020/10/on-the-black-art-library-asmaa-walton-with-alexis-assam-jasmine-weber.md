      Asmaa Walton is a Detroit native and founder of the Black Art Library, a
      collection of books she began curating on Black visual arts in early 2020.
      The Black Art Library will be a public-facing archive, research library,
      and collection of art books, children’s books, exhibition catalogues,
      biographies, and ephemera on Black visual arts and artists intended to be
      an educational resource for the Black community and beyond. The project
      started this year, and is currently fundraising to expand its collection
      and acquire a brick-and-mortar space that will act as a non-lending
      library based in Detroit, MI. Walton holds an MA in Arts Politics from the
      Department of Art & Public Policy at New York University, and a BFA in
      Arts Education from Michigan State University. She was previously the
      inaugural Keybank Fellow at The Toledo Museum of Art, and the 2019–2020
      Romare Bearden Graduate Museum Fellow at the Saint Louis Art Museum.

Please join us for our tenth installment of Common Ground for a conversation on the **Black Art Library** in Detroit featuring founder **Asmaa Walton** in conversation with curator **Alexis Assam** and art writer & editor **Jasmine Weber**.

This conversation will be moderated by **Malvika Jolly**, and will close with a poetry reading by **Karisma Price**. 

### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the New Social Environment—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for Common Ground, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
