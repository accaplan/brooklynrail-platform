      books, children’s books, exhibition catalogues, biographies, and ephemera
      on Black visual arts and artists intended to be an educational resource
      for the Black community and beyond. The project started this year, and is
      currently fundraising to expand its collection and acquire a

### **About this series**

At the start of quarantine, the *Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the New Social Environment—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for Common Ground, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.
