  - person: tonika-lewis-johnson
    event_bio: Tonika Lewis Johnson is a photographer, visual artist, and lifelong
      resident of Chicago’s South Side neighborhood of Englewood. In 2010, she
      helped cofound the Resident Association of Greater Englewood (RAGE), whose
      mission is to mobilize people and resources to force positive change in
      Englewood through solution-based approaches. She is also a lead cofounder
      of the Englewood Arts Collective, established in 2017 to help artistically
      reframe the narrative of Englewood. Within her artistic practice, Tonika
      explores urban segregation and documents the nuance and richness of the
      Black community. As a trained photojournalist and teaching artist, she has
      been engaged in building an artistic legacy that has gained citywide
      recognition in the last three years. She has been featured in Chicago
      magazine as a 2017 Chicagoan of the Year for her photography of
      Englewood's everyday beauty, countering its pervasive media coverage of
      poverty and crime. Her Englewood-based photography projects From the
      INside, and Everyday Rituals have been exhibited at Rootwork Gallery, the
      Chicago Cultural Center, Harold Washington Library, and the Loyola
      University Museum of Art (LUMA). Her Folded Map project visually
      investigates disparities among Chicago residents while bringing them
      together to have a conversation, and was also exhibited at the Loyola
      University Museum of Art (2018). Since then, she has transformed Folded
      Map into an advocacy and policy-influencing tool that invites audiences to
      open dialogues and question how we are all socially impacted by racial and
      institutional conditions that segregate the city. In 2019, she was named
      one of Field Foundation’s “Leaders for a New Chicago” and, most recently,
      she was appointed as a member of the Cultural Advisory Council of the
      Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events by the Chicago City
      Council.

> "What you believe about a neighborhood has a history. And, whether you choose to believe it or not—that history is directly connected to racism." —Tonika Johnson

At the start of quarantine, the *Brooklyn Rail* asked how might we stay connected to each other in a time of self-isolation? Now we ask: How can we stay involved and engaged in upholding our civic responsibility to one another across communities? How can we deploy this community built through the *New Social Environment*—through hundreds of conversations and meals shared over the past six months—to mobilize daily action for grassroots movements, social justice and equity projects, and for the political good of our most marginalized communities across the nation? Tune in Thursdays at 1pm for *Common Ground*, a new lunchtime series featuring weekly conversations with social justice practitioners, changemakers, and activists on how we can mobilize our daily actions to radically reimagine our democracy.

Please join us for our sixth installment of *Common Ground*, when we will be joined by Chicago-based photographers **Tonika Lewis Johnson** and **Lee Bey** for a conversation on the *[Folded Map](https://www.foldedmapproject.com/)* project and cultural life in the South Side of Chicago. We will close with a reading by poet **I.S. Jones**.
