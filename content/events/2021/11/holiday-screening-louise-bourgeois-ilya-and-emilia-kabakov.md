***Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine*** is a cinematic journey inside the life and imagination of an icon of modern art. As a screen presence, Louise Bourgeois is magnetic, mercurial, and emotionally raw. There is no separation between her life as an artist and the memories and emotions that affect her every day. In 1982, at the age of 71, she became the first woman to be honored with a major retrospective at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Filmed with unparalleled access between 1993 and 2007, *Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine* is an intimate, human, and educational engagement with an artist’s world.

***Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Enter Here*** portrays two of Russia’s most celebrated international artists, now American citizens, as they come to terms with the new Russia. Two decades after he fled the Soviet Union, Ilya Kabakov overcomes his fears to create six art installations in venues throughout Moscow, where he was once forbidden to exhibit his art. Amidst the cacophony of a city and a country in dizzying transition, he comes face to face with the memories that have made him who he is.
