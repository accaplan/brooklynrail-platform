    event_bio: "University Reader in Modern and Contemporary Art Theory, Juan
      Vicente Aliaga is associated with the Faculty of Fine Arts at the
      Polytechnic University of Valencia. His research is centred around
      feminist, gender, and queer studies with special attention to cultural,
      artistic, and political representations of sexual diversity. His teaching
      has also focused on the key role played by micro-politics and the
      contribution of intercultural, postcolonial and decolonial studies. He is
      currently exploring three main research topics: _Feminist genealogies in
      Spanish art from the 1960s onwards, Cultural, artistic and visual presence
      and agency of sexual diversity in the world_, and _Critical revision of
      modern art from a gender and sexual perspective_. The first of these
      topics was addressed in the exhibition curated for MUSAC (León),
      _Genealogías feministas en el arte español: 1960-2010_ (2013); the second
      issue has been tackled in a book on the work of Lebanese artist Akram
      Zaatari, _The Uneasy Subject_ (Charta, Milan, 2011), and also in an
      exhibition held at both MUSAC in 2011 and MUAC (Mexico City, 2012). He has
      also curated an exhibition in 2009 entitled _Everywhere: Politics of
      Sexual Diversity in Art_ at CGAC, Santiago de Compostela. The third issue
      has involved curating an exhibition on the French photographer Claude
      Cahun held at the Jeu de Paume (Paris) and La Virreina, Centre de la
      Imatge (Barcelona) both in 2011, and at The Art Institute of Chicago in
      2012. As an outcome of this project, a book was published in France
      (_Claude Cahun_, ed. Hazan, Paris, 2011). Recently in 2020, he has curated
      an exhibition at IVAM (Valencia Institute of Modern Art) entitled _Moral
      Dis/Order: Art and Sexuality in Europe between the Wars_. "
