      Jackie Nickerson began photographing Zimbabwean farm workers in 1996 as a
      way to change the perception that those who work in African agriculture
      are disempowered, unmodern people. The resulting series, ‘Farm’, focused
      on the unique and beautiful clothing the workers made for themselves, and
      by doing so highlighted the worker’s identity, individuality, and
      ultimately their modernism. This was published by Jonathan Cape in
      September 2002. (German edition, ‘Leben Mit Der Erde’, published by
      Frederking and Thaler, 2002; French edition, ‘Une Autre Afrique’,
      published by Flammarion, 2002. 


      For her most recent series, ‘Field Test’, published by Kerber Verlag, October 2020, Nickerson questions the life-style choices of the people of this world and reflects a contemporary reality in which the autonomous human subject is a compromised, problematic entity. Nickerson’s photo sculptures dismantle and reconstruct, protect and destroy the individual human being. ‘Field Test’ is a further elaboration on Nickerson’s long-term interest in how people inhabit, experience and impact on the world around them, and how their circumstances shape and define their lives.


      Nickerson divides her time between London and rural Ireland. She is represented by Jack Shainman Gallery in New York.
