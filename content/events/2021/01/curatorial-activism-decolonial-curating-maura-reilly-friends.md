      Video and installation artist Shirin Neshat (Iranian, b.1957) explores the
      political and social conditions of Iranian and Muslim life in her works,
      particularly focusing on women and feminist issues. Neshat was born in
      Qazvin, Iran, and left the country to study art in the United States at
      17; she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with an MFA
      in 1982. When she returned to her home country in 1990, she found it
      barely recognizable from the Iran before the 1979 Revolution, a shocking
      experience that incited the meditations on memory, loss, and contemporary
      life in Iran that are central to her work.


      Her Women of Allah series, created in the mid-1990s, introduced the hallmark themes of her pieces through which she examines conditions of male, female, public, private, religious, political, and secular identities in both Iranian and Western cultures. Her videos, installations, and photographs have received great international critical acclaim outside of Iran. In 2019, The Broad Museum, Los Angeles, presented Shirin Neshat: I Will Greet the Sun Again, a survey of 25 years of the artist's work, and her current exhibit Shirin Neshat: Land of Dreams at Gladstone Gallery, New York, is on view through February 27, 2021. Neshat currently lives and works in New York.
  - person: shoja-azari
    event_bio: Shoja Azari is an Iranian-born visual artist and filmmaker known for
      films such as Women Without Men (2009), Windows (2006), and K (2002),
      based on three of Franz Kafka's short stories ("The Married Couple," "In
      the Penal Colony," and "A Fratricide"). In his work, Azari confronts broad
      themes of gender, politics, and piety, drawing inspiration from and
      re-interpreting religious icons. While collaborating with Shirin Neshat on
      a wealth of film and video projects, Azari created experimental and art
      house films, including an adaptation of Franz Kafka’s work, K (2000) and a
      series of short films, Windows (2005). Windows premiered at the Tribeca
      Film Festival, bringing him into the public eye. Azari and Neshat’s film
      Women Without Men won the Silver Lion for best director at the 2009 Venice
      Film Festival. Azari has since developed a style of “video paintings” that
      combine media to produce a unique three-dimensional effect. He has
      partnered with artist Shahram Karimi on a variety of multimedia projects.
      Azari’s work has been exhibited globally and is included in international
      permanent collections. He lives and works in New York.
