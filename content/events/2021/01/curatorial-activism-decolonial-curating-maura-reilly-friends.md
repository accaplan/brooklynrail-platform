      Richard Bell is a member of the Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang
      communities. An activist and artist, Bell works across video, painting,
      installation and text to pose provocative, complex and humorous challenges
      to our preconceived ideas of Aboriginal art, as well as addressing
      contemporary debates around identity, place and politics.


      Solo exhibitions of his work include Richard Bell: Imagining Victory, Western Plains Cultural Centre, Dubbo (2015); Embassy, Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Perth (2014); and Imagining Victory, Artspace, Sydney (2013). Uz vs Them, a major touring exhibition of Bell’s work organised by the American Federation of Arts, premiered at Tufts University, Boston in September 2011 and toured to venues across North America throughout 2013. In 2009 an exhibition of Bell’s practice to date, titled I am not sorry, was held at Location One, New York, and he was the recipient of Location One’s International Fellowship for that year. In 2006 his work was the subject of the survey exhibition Positivity presented by the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane.
