    event_bio: "W. J. T. Mitchell is editor of the interdisciplinary journal,
      Critical Inquiry, a quarterly devoted to critical theory in the arts and
      human sciences. A scholar and theorist of media, visual art, and
      literature, Mitchell is associated with the emergent fields of visual
      culture and iconology (the study of images across the media). He is known
      especially for his work on the relations of visual and verbal
      representations in the context of social and political issues. Under his
      editorship,  Critical Inquiry has published special issues on public art,
      psychoanalysis, pluralism, feminism, the sociology of literature, canons,
      race and identity, narrative, the politics of interpretation, postcolonial
      theory, and many other topics. He has been the recipient of numerous
      awards including the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Morey Prize in art
      history given by the College Art Association of America. "
