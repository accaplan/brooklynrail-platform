    event_bio: "Since the mid-1980s, Tishan Hsu’s prescient artistic practice has
      been probing the cognitive as well as physical effects of transformative
      technological advances on our lives. Through the use of unusual materials,
      software tools, and innovative fabrication techniques, his enigmatic
      paintings and sculptures explore and manifest poetic new ways to engage
      and reimagine the human body. Hsu has been making the majority of his
      paintings on canvas since the late 1980s using a silkscreen process to
      juxtapose images of his close-up pastel drawings of flesh with
      appropriated biomedical images of orifices and body parts. The scale of
      these works is such that the dot matrix of the silkscreens is markedly
      legible. His most recent paintings, further, almost announce their
      techno-mediation through an evident digital reproducibility. Various
      re-engaged motifs from his visual vocabulary are now warped and morphing
      into hardware and screens and become part of a larger corporeal entity. "
