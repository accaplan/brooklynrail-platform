This summer, we are celebrating the sections of the *Brooklyn Rail* with conversations, performances, and readings curated by our editors. This 2-week YouTube video series offers a view behind the scenes with the editors, artists, and writers that make the publication.

On Wednesday, July 28, Theater editors Billy McEntee and Ayanna Prescod are joined by Tony award-winning costume and set designer Clint Ramos for a conversation on Ramos's inspiration, design techniques, and theater career.
