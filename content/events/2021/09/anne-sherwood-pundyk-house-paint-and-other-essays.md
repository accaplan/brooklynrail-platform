**Pundyk works with paint and unstretched canvas on the floor, the wall and the sloping lawn outside her studio on the North Fork of Long Island to make large-scale paintings of color stained and stitched fabric panels. Alongside these works she bases her photographs around  her daily notebook writing, creating images using a home office scanner, Photoshop, an iPhone and a glitchy archival inkjet printer. Pundyk’s expansive abstract paintings and intimate color photographs of handwritten journal pages have a presence both familiar and otherworldly.** 

Opening Reception: September 19 1P – 6P
