***3000 minutes*** is a durational sound work commemorating the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the hijacked plane attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people were killed during the 9/11 attacks. 20 years later, the US is moving its military presence out of Afghanistan, creating many questions about the duration of war and its consequences. *3000 minutes* is an original work by Lauren Bon and in this work, she is taking an analog music score composed by her collaborator Douglas Lee and repeating it over and over similar to the images many of us witnessed 20 years ago of the World Trade Center twin towers collapsing. In Bon’s composition, each repetition has a different time signature rendering the loop familiar and unfamiliar.

***3000 minutes*** can be listened to live beginning Friday, September 10 on [www.satelliteradiochoir.org](http://www.satelliteradiochoir.org/). The transmission will be streamed live from the silo on the edge of the Owens dry lake in Payahuunadü, a place where Lauren Bon’s Metabolic Studio Sonic Division operates.

**A public recitation will be held over Zoom on Sunday, September 12 at 12pm ET / 9am PT to conclude this sound work.**
