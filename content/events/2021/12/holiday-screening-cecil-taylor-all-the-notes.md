Cecil Taylor is the grand master of free jazz piano. ***All the Notes*** captures, in breezy fashion, the unconventional stance of this media-shy modern musical genius, who is regarded as one of the true giants of post-war music.

📖  Our tradition is to conclude each event with a poetry reading, so we encourage you to read poems from our current issue after watching the films.
