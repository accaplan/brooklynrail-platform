A film within a film, ***Looking for Oum Kulthum*** is the plight of an Iranian woman artist/filmmaker living in exile, as she embarks on capturing the life and art of the legendary female singer of the Arab world, Oum Kulthum. Through her difficult journey, not unlike her heroine’s, she has to face the struggles, sacrifices, and the price that a woman has to pay if she dares to cross the lines of a conservative male dominated society.

📖 Our tradition is to conclude each event with a poetry reading, so we encourage you to read poems from our current issue after watching the films.
