Renowned visual artist Shirin Neshat offers an exquisitely crafted view of women rights today in Iran as compared to Iran in 1953, when a British- and American-backed coup removed the democratically elected government. ***Women Without Men*** was adapted from the novel by Iranian author Shahrnush Parsipur and weaves together the stories of four individual women during those traumatic days, whose experiences are shaped by their faith and the social structures in place.

üìñ  Our tradition is to conclude each event with a poetry reading, so we encourage you to read poems from our current issue after watching the films.
