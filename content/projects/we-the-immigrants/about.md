As we look towards the 2020 election, its aftermath, and consider the future of our fragile democracy, the Rail is undertaking an urgent project aimed at emphasizing immigration and its prevalence in various communities across America, especially those who have made significant contributions to the cultural fabric of society.

As a founding principle of an open society, and as Americans from a cultural perspective, we feel strongly that we do not need to conform to homogeneity, singing in union. We should aspire to be instead a multiplicity in unity, an inclusion of all walks of life from different generations, genders, and cultural backgrounds, from which each of us is treasured as an instrument that has its own unique sound, unlike any other, but together each contributes to the total sound of a beautiful symphony. Hence the very idea of immigration is concerned with much more than naturalization, citizenship, and territory.

We believe our creation of [We The Immigrants](/projects/we-the-immigrants/) website is an important and ever-timely documentation. Inspired by the grid that humanizes every of the diverse participants in our daily zoom forum New Social Environment Lunchtime Conversation series (launched on March 17, 2019), we’ve similarly deployed the 26 letters of the alphabet in the grid structure. Where each letter, from A to Z, will document every name of every creative individual from the commonwealth of the sciences, arts, and humanities (past and present) as long as his, her, their name fits orderly to each letter. Each face includes only full names, place and year of birth (year of death for the deceased). Taking the advantage of countless blocks, filled with storefronts that are currently covered with ply-woods in various large cities and small towns during the pandemic, we encourage our friends and colleagues, fellow human beings, especially those who have access to printing facilities from universities and colleges to add more names of identical criteria, then print them out, wheat paste them as symphony of faces, with the permission of each property’s owner, on the grid formation. We deeply feel We The Immigrants, as an ongoing project, has the potential to raise awareness, create dialogue, and above all provide a common ground from which immigration policy can be resourceful as the quintessential idea of the American dream.
