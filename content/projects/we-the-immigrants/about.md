As we look towards the 2020 election and consider the future of our country, the Rail is undertaking an urgent project aimed at elevating immigration in communities across America and the role it plays in shaping democracy and the innovative, cultural fabric of society.

In response to current policy, we are creating an immersive and accessible experience on Instagram and the Brooklyn Rail website that will document the hundreds of creative individuals across the sciences, arts, and humanities (past and present) that’ve immigrated to the U.S. and made an impact.


This an urgent project aimed at elevating immigration in communities across America and the role it plays in shaping democracy and the innovative, cultural fabric of society.

This campaign will play out across social media and as large-format posters and printed objects in communities across America, in partnership with the Rail’s diverse audience and network of foundations, nonprofits, and universities that advocate for equality, human rights, and immigration in every city in the country.

Join us in supporting this important and timely project, so that we can heighten awareness, create dialogue, and find common ground around the importance of immigration in the coming election.
