short_bio: Dealing with icons and characters, **Glenn Goldberg** is a painter
  whose work expresses a dialogue with the decorative arts. Textiles, cloth, and
  patterns co-exist within his painting language, casting his most well-known
  subjects—birds, dogs, flowers, and cells—in scenes that embody complexity,
  awkwardness, and vibrancy. Goldberg studied at the New York Studio School and
  received his MFA from Queens College. He has been represented by Willard and
  Knoedler Galleries, and has received grants from the Edward Albee Foundation,
  the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Arts. His work
  is included in the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum collections,
  among others.
