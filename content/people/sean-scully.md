short_bio: "Sean Scully was born in Dublin in 1945, grew up in the south of
  London, and moved to New York City in 1975. Sean Scully is known for rich,
  painterly abstractions in which stripes or blocks of layered color are a
  prevailing motif. The delineated geometry of his work provides structure for
  an expressive, physical rendering of color, light, and texture. Scully’s
  simplification of his compositions and use of repetitive forms—squares,
  rectangles, bands—echoes architectural motifs (doors, windows, walls) and in
  this way appeals to a universal understanding and temporal navigation of the
  picture plane. However, the intimacy of Scully’s process, in which he layers
  and manipulates paint with varying brushstrokes and sensibilities, results in
  a highly sensual and tactile materiality. "
