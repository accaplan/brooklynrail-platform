short_bio: "Since graduating from Yale in 1967, Judith Bernstein has developed a
  reputation as one of the most unwaveringly provocative artists of her
  generation. Steadfast in her cultural, political and social critique for over
  50 years, Bernstein surged into art world prominence in the early 1970s with
  her monumental charcoal drawings of penis-screw hybrids; early incarnations of
  which were exhibited at AIR Gallery; Brooks Jackson Iolas Gallery, New York;
  Brooklyn Museum; and MoMA P.S. 1, among other institutions. "
