short_bio: Acclaimed artist and activist **Mary Frank** has been making art in
  her Manhattan and Hudson Valley studios for over sixty years. During her
  formative years she made semi-abstract figures carved from wood and plaster. A
  shift to clay in the late sixties was a revelation as she discovered an
  improvisatory process. In the early '70s she broke into public view with
  distinctive clay sculptures of the female form. Since then, she has made work
  in a broad range of media including sculptures in clay, cast bronze, and
  plaster along with paintings, drawings, prints, and photographs. Her work is
  powerfully, if obliquely narrative and has always centered on the twin themes
  of social justice and the preservation of the natural world.
