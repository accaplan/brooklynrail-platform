short_bio: Sculptor, painter, photographer and a fierce advocate for human
  rights, **Mary Frank**’s work is in the collections of the Metropolitan,
  Whitney and Brooklyn Museums and numerous private collections. Represented by
  DC Moore and Elena Zang Galleries in New York, she lives and works in
  Manhattan and Bearsville, New York. “Endlessly I ask myself- what is art for?
  The list changes. When people make music they inhale, connect their eyes and,
  on exhalation, begin the music- I would love to make that moment visible. A
  body of work is a wonderful expression.  The feet, the space between the
  bones, the sigh, the scream, the wings, the eyes, the connective tissue in us
  and between all living things.”
