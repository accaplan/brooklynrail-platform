short_bio: "Artist **Alison Elizabeth Taylor** is known for transforming the
  historic technique of marquetry or wood inlay into a new form: marquetry
  hybridâ€”a novel synthesis of media and process that incorporates inlaid wood,
  painting, and collaged textures to create a new perspective on painting.
  Taylor casts a critical and compassionate eye across the breadth of
  contemporary American experience and pays respect to the innate humanity of
  her subjects through her choice of this extraordinarily demanding medium. In
  2022, Taylor will be the subject of a major museum survey exhibition.
  Organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Massachusetts,
  this touring exhibition will open at Des Moines Art Center in October 2022
  with more than 40 career-spanning works."
