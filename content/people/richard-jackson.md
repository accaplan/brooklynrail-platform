short_bio: A pre-eminent figure in American contemporary art since the 1970s,
  **Richard Jackson** is influenced by both Abstract Expressionism and action
  painting, exploring a performative painting process which seeks to extend the
  potential of painting by upending its technical conventions. Born in
  Sacramento, California in 1939, Jackson first came to international attention
  with a major presentation of his installation works at the Menil Collection,
  Houston, in 1988, followed by the 1992 exhibition, ‘Helter Skelter,’ at the
  Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.
