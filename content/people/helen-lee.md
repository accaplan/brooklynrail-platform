short_bio: Helen Lee has had many roles in the art world, including collector,
  academic, art advisor, art book editor, and auction house specialist. She has
  worked at Christieâ€™s, Harry N. Abrams Publishing, the Robert Miller Gallery,
  and for James Wolfensohn, among others. Her passion for the arts derives from
  her belief that art and culture provide vital means of communication across
  cultural and political divides. All art forms, whether through music, theater,
  dance, poetry, or literature, help us to make sense of the world and current
  events and can clarify how best to move forward. Helen is an advisor to the
  Milken Institute for its art and culture programming. She is the Chairman of
  the American Foundation for the Courtauld Institute of Art, where she
  completed her post-graduate studies.
