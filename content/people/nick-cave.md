short_bio: Artist, educator and foremost a messenger, **Nick Cave** (b. 1959,
  Fulton, MO; lives and works in Chicago, IL)  works between the visual and
  performing arts through a wide range of mediums including sculpture,
  installation, video, sound and performance. Cave is well known for his
  Soundsuits, sculptural forms based on the scale of his body, initially created
  in direct response to the police beating of Rodney King in 1991. Soundsuits
  camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race,
  gender and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment. They serve as a
  visual embodiment of social justice that represent both brutality and
  empowerment.
