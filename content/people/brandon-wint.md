short_bio: "Ontario born poet and spoken word artist **Brandon Wint** uses
  poetry to attend to the joy and devastation and inequity associated with this
  era of human and ecological history. Increasingly, his work on the page and in
  performance casts a tender but robust attention toward the movements and
  impacts of colonial, capitalist logic, and how they might be undone. His poems
  and essays have been published in national anthologies, including _The Great
  Black North: Contemporary African-Canadian Poetry_ (Frontenac House, 2013) and
  _Black Writers Matter_ (University of Regina Press, 2019). _Divine Animal_ is
  his debut book of poetry."
