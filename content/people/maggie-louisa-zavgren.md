short_bio: "Maggie Louisa Zavgren is a poet who walks the ontological plain from
  nameless-formlessness to sacred and inimitable distinction. Her work has
  appeared in _Caesura_, _The Doris_, _Metambesen_, _Blazing Stadium_, _The
  Swan_, and _SALT_. Raised in the shadow of Mount Monadnock, she has been out
  to graze ever since. Zavgren currently edits “Swan Essays,” a biannual
  compendium of essays by poets. Her published works include _Kotekan_ (The
  Swan), _Triptych: Kigali-Gulu_, _Eight Days_ (Metambesen), _The Night Orchard_
  (The Doris/Books), and _The Isle of You_ (Catskill Mountain Foundation
  Press)."
