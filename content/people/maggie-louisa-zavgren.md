short_bio: "Raised in the shadow of Mount Monadnock in southern New
  Hampshire,  **Maggie Louisa Zavgren** has been out to graze ever since. She is
  a poet who walks the ontological plain from nameless-formlessness to sacred
  and inimitable distinction. Her work has appeared in _Caesura_, _The Doris_,
  _Metambesen_, _Blazing Stadium_, _The Swan_, and _SALT_. Zavgren currently
  edits “Swan Essays,” a biannual compendium of essays by poets. Her published
  works include _Kotekan_ (The Swan), _Triptych: Kigali-Gulu_, _Eight Days_
  (Metambesen), _The Night Orchard_ (The Doris/Books), and _The Isle of You_
  (Catskill Mountain Foundation Press)."
