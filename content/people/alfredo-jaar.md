short_bio: "Artist, architect, and filmmaker **Alfredo Jaar** uses photography,
  sculpture, and film to consistently provoke, question, and search for ways to
  heighten our consciousness about issues often forgotten or suppressed in the
  international sphere, while not relinquishing artâ€™s formal and aesthetic
  power. Over his career, Jaar has explored political and social issues
  including genocide, the displacement of refugees across borders, and the
  balance of power between developing and industrialized nations. In 2019, the
  artist was awarded the 11th Hiroshima Art Prize for his contributions
  throughout his career to peace construction. An ongoing exhibition _Alfredo
  Jaar: The Structure of Images_, is on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art
  Chicago through July 3, 2022."
