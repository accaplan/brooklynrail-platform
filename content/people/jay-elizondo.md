short_bio: Artist **Jay Elizondo**’s photographs, short film and installation
  include a performance of the artist as her mother, emulating and
  recontextualizing models of femininity the artist was deprived of as an
  adolescent who was assigned male at birth. In Elizondo’s work the body and the
  object are both queered in the blending of still and moving image, memoir and
  fantasy, present and past.
