short_bio: "Widely recognized as one of the most creative and innovative
  guitarists, improvisers, and producers of rock, jazz, and experimental music,
  Grammy winner **Henry Kaiser** is one of the “first generation” of American
  free improvisers, and has helped unfetter guitar from the conventions of
  genre-bound techniques. A restless collaborator who constantly seeks the most
  diverse and challenging contexts for his music, he not only produces and
  contributes to a staggering number of recorded projects, he performs
  frequently throughout the USA, Europe and Japan. Evidence of his exceptional
  musical breadth and versatility can be found in a partial list of the
  extraordinary artists with whom he has recorded and/or performed: Herbie
  Hancock David Lindley, and many others."
