short_bio: Andrei Codrescu was born in Transylvania, Romania, reborn at the age
  of 19 in Detroit and New York in 1967-1970. A professional nomad he has lived
  in San Francisco, Monte Rio California on the Russian River, Baltimore, Baton
  Rouge and New Orleans. He is the recipient of 40,000 angry letters from Ralph
  Reed’s “silent majority” for urging Christian believers in the “Rapture” to
  ascend to Heaven as quickly as the Lord will make room for them. He did this
  on NPR, which as we know, is the radio station all evangelicals listen to –
  religiously. Codrescu’s first book of poetry was “License to Carry a Gun” in
  1970, and his most recent, “The Art of Forgetting” (2019). He writes novels
  and essays and won the Peabody award for the film “Road Scholar.”
