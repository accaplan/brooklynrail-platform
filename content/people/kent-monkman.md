short_bio: "Kent Monkman is an interdisciplinary Cree visual artist. A member of
  Fisher River Cree Nation in Treaty 5 Territory (Manitoba), he lives and works
  in Dish With One Spoon Territory (Toronto, Canada). Known for his provocative
  interventions into Western European and American art history, Monkman explores
  themes of colonization, sexuality, loss, and resilience—the complexities of
  historic and contemporary Indigenous experiences—across painting, film/video,
  performance, and installation. Monkman’s gender-fluid alter ego Miss Chief
  Eagle Testickle often appears in his work as a time-traveling, shape-shifting,
  supernatural being who reverses the colonial gaze to challenge received
  notions of history and Indigenous peoples. "
