short_bio: "**Alamgir Hashmi** is said to have been born in this part of Planet
  Earth and trained, persuasively, formally and informally, to stay on here. His
  parents taught him many fine things of life including reading, writing, and
  listening. Later he went on to write mainly in different forms of poetry and
  prose, and to teach (subjects like language, literature, culture,
  interdisciplinary studies, and theory). Perhaps better known as an English
  poet, he has been a professor of English and comparative literature, an editor
  of literary and scholarly journals, a scholar-critic, a broadcaster, a
  translator, long lapsed lay minstrel, and a weekend canoeist. His work spans
  nearly all continents, for over four decades now, and he lives wherever his
  work lives. He acknowledges life as a gift."
