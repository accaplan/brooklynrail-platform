short_bio: Born in Chicago in 1943, **Senga Nengudi** lives and works in
  Colorado Springs.  In the 1970s, Nengudi became a leading force within the
  emerging community of Black artists and musicians whose work engaged with the
  radical politics of the time through an abstract and dematerialized visual
  vocabulary. Her media-spanning oeuvre draws on a range of influences including
  free jazz and spoken word, Yoruba mythology, Japanese art and theater,
  Brazilian Constructivism, and African ritual. Characterized by experimentation
  with process, material, and form, Nengudiâ€™s work challenges and reimagines the
  traditional narratives of Post-Minimalism and Conceptual Art, while reframing
  the broader histories of both feminism and the Black Power Movement.
