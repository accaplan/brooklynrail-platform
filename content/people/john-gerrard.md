short_bio: John Gerrard is best known for his sculptures and installations,
  which typically take the form of digital simulations, displayed using
  real-time computer graphics. Gerrard’s works concern themselves with the
  nature of contemporary power by exemplifying the mass structures and vast
  networks of energy which materialised during the twentieth century. Gerrard’s
  method of production involves taking tens of thousands of digital photographs
  and then recreating a scene with them by implementing the same technology used
  for video games. The result is seemingly realistic but artificial in
  actuality. Such virtual technology has become standard in the videogames
  industry, which evolved from US military simulation exercises; yet it has
  rarely crossed over into the visual arts.
