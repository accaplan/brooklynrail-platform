short_bio: Paul Ramírez Jonas was born in Pomona, California in 1965 and raised
  in Honduras. Educated at Brown University and RISD, Ramírez Jonas, now lives
  and works in Brooklyn. Over the last twenty-five years Ramírez Jonas has
  created works that range from large-scale public installations and monumental
  sculptures to intimate drawings, performances and videos. Through his practice
  he seeks to challenge definitions of art and the public, engineering active
  audience participation and exchange. Multiples based on everyday objects such
  as coins also are a reoccurring motif, allowing the artist to question notions
  of value, circulation, and societal rituals or behaviors. He is an Associate
  Professor at Hunter College and is represented Galeria Nara Roesler.
