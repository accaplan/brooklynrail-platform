short_bio: "**Maya Hayuk** is a Ukrainian-American artist with an extensive
  background in a wide range of generative art and social practices. Hayuk
  weaves visual information from her immediate surroundings into elaborate,
  painterly abstractions, thus creating an engaging mix of referents from
  popular culture and advanced painting practices alike. Her large-scale,
  improvised murals speak to the artist’s obsession with symmetry, “perfect
  imperfection” and outer/ inner space. Hayuk’s work has been the subject of one
  person exhibitions and commissions at venues including FRAC Museum in
  Dunkerque, FR (2019), The Ukrainian Museum New York (2017), The Bowery Wall,
  NY (2014), and The Hammer Museum, LA (2013). "
