short_bio: "Ukrainian-American artist  **Maya Hayuk** weaves visual information
  from her immediate surroundings into elaborate, painterly abstractions, thus
  creating an engaging mix of referents from popular culture and advanced
  painting practices alike. Her large-scale, improvised murals speak to the
  artist’s obsession with symmetry, “perfect imperfection” and outer/ inner
  space. Hayuk’s work has been the subject of one person exhibitions and
  commissions at venues including FRAC Museum in Dunkerque, FR (2019), The
  Ukrainian Museum New York (2017), The Bowery Wall, NY (2014), The Hammer
  Museum, LA (2013), and a forthcoming commission with the Brooklyn Museum.
  Hayuk has been teaching this past semester in MIT’s Masters of Architecture
  Program. "
