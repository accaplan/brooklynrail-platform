short_bio: Joan Waltemath grew up on the Great Plains and now lives and works in
  New York City.  Drawing has long been at the root of her artistic practice,
  serving as a way of thinking though visual material in preparation for
  painting.  At the same time Waltemath challenges her drawings to be autonomous
  works, which are made using diverse wet and dry materials.  Her abstract
  paintings focus on constructing spatial voids using harmonic progressions and
  non-traditional, reflective pigments in oil; their scale and dimensions
  address the body.  New sewn canvas works explore the poetics of contingency.
