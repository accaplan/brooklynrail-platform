short_bio: American artist based in New York, **Katherine Bradford** is best
  known for paintings of swimmers, superheroes and ships that critics describe
  as simultaneously representational and abstract, luminous, and richly
  metaphorical. Bradford explores the complexities of loneliness, agency, gender
  roles, and consciousness, among other topics. Her radiant work features
  whimsical subject matter such as floating heads, UFOs, and bikini-clad
  bathers. Often utilizing a palette of pinks and deep blues, Bradford paints
  her subjects against layered, color-field backdrops that reference the work of
  Mark Rothko. Bradford is an alumna of Bryn Mawr College, and received her MFA
  from SUNY Purchase.
