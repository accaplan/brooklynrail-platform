short_bio: "New York based artist **Katherine Bradford** is known for her
  paintings of people in luminous fields of color. Bradford paints with a formal
  inventiveness and a shifting sense of figure and ground, giving narrative
  weight to her characters who may appear as heroes or lovers, families or
  couples, businessmen or isolated individuals. She began her career as artist
  relatively late in life and has achieved her widest recognition in her
  seventies, through New York gallery shows at CANADA, Sperone Westwater, and
  Pace. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Joan Mitchell
  Grant. She has taught at Yale School of Art and the Skowhegan School of
  Painting and Sculpture. "
