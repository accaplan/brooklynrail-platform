short_bio: "Working at the intersection of politics and theory, **Mira Schor**
  is an artist noted for her contributions to feminist art history. Her works
  center on the representation of language in drawing and painting, and her
  current work focuses on the experience of living in a moment of radical
  inequality, austerity, and accelerated time, set against the powerful pull of
  older notions of time, craft, and visual pleasure. Her work has been widely
  exhibited, including at the Hammer Museum, P.S.1, The Neuberger Museum, The
  Jewish Museum, and The Aldrich Museum. She is the recipient of awards from the
  Guggenheim, Rockefeller, Marie Walsh Sharpe, and Pollock-Krasner Foundations,
  as well as the College Art Associationâ€™s Frank Jewett Mather Award in Art
  Criticism. "
