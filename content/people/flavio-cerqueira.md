short_bio: "As an artist and storyteller, **Flávio Cerqueira** creates vigorous
  figurative bronze sculptures, focused on the construction of narratives and
  representation of actions. The presence of everyday objects, such as mirrors,
  books, tree trunks, ramps, or stairs, creates tension with the out-of-scale
  bronze human figures. These scenarios take place inside the white cube, which
  functions as a pedestal, an attempt to blur the boundaries between sculpture
  and world and between the artwork and the viewer. Its intention is to
  problematize the relationship between space and spectator. Cerqueira uses
  sculpture as a tool to immobilize the moment of the fragment of a narrative. "
