short_bio: "Artist **Sheida Soleimani**â€™s work explores intersections of art and
  activism, melding sculpture, performance, film and photography to highlight
  critical perspectives on events across the Middle East. Through constructing
  staged sets in her studio and documenting them with the camera, Soleimani
  focuses on the dissemination of information, adapting images from press and
  social media leaks to exist within alternative scenarios. Soleimani is the
  daughter of political refugees persecuted by the Iranian government in the
  1980s; as such, engagement with Iran is an ongoing facet of her practice. "
