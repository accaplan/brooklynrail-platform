short_bio: Artist **Anna Campbell**’s research-based practice employs props,
  scaffold, and trusswork to support models of representation for queer forms
  that challenge the gaze of classifying taxonomies. Appropriated and abstracted
  references to domestic spaces, gay bars, and other more provisional
  architectures poach key signifiers of gender- and hetero-normativity and open
  them onto new attachments of possibility and desire from what might seem
  otherwise to be static legacies. Campbell’s work is in the collections of MoMA
  Library and the Leslie Lohman Museum, among others, and her site-specific,
  bronze sculpture is permanently installed at the Lesbian Herstory Archives in
  Brooklyn.
