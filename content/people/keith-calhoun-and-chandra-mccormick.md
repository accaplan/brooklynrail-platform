first_name: Keith and Chandra
short_bio: "Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick were born and raised in New
  Orleans. As husband and wife team, they have been documenting Louisiana and
  its people for more than 25 years. Calhoun and McCormick have documented the
  soul of New Orleans and a vanishing Louisiana: the last of the sugar cane
  workers, the dockworkers, the sweet potato harvesters, and the displacement of
  African Americans after Katrina. They photograph the traditions of black
  church services and religious rituals; community rites and celebrations, such
  as parades, and jazz funerals; and the cruel conditions of the Louisiana State
  Penitentiary at Angola, a former slave-breeding plantation named for the
  African nation from which “the most profitable” slaves, according to slave
  owners, were kidnapped."
