short_bio: Artist, art writer, and arts worker **Amanda Millet-Sorsa** was born
  in Washington D.C. (1987) to French and Finnish parents, and currently is
  based in New York City. She recently completed a collaborative performance
  project, _A Game of Tarot_ (2021), an absurd five person card playing
  performance using Amanda Millet-Sorsa’s reimagined tarot cards while reciting
  “Auguries of Innocence” by William Blake and directed by poet Alexandra
  Zelman-Doring. This cross-disciplinary work focused on visual art, poetry, and
  theatre uniting the synchronistic encounter between an artist, a writer, and
  Jim Drougas, owner of “The Unoppressive Non-Imperialist Bargain Bookstore” on
  Carmine Street in the West Village, NY.
