short_bio: Ibrahim Mahama was born in 1987 in Tamale, Ghana. He lives and works
  in Accra, Kumasi and Tamale. He uses the transformation of materials to
  explore themes of commodity, migration, globalization and economic exchange.
  His large-scale installations employ materials gathered from urban
  environments. Mahamaâ€™s interest in material, process and audience first led
  him to focus on jute sacks that are synonymous with the trade markets of Ghana
  where he lives and works. Fabricated in South East Asia, the sacks are
  imported by the Ghana Cocoa Boards to transport cocoa beans and eventually end
  up as multi-functional objects, used for the transportation of food, charcoal
  and other commodities.
