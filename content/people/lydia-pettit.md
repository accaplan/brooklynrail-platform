short_bio: Lydia Pettit's works are confrontational depictions of her own inward
  gaze, forcing the viewer to reckon with the realities of her body and mind,
  and their own viewpoints on the struggles women face with sexual abuse,
  trauma, body politics, and mental health. Her materials range from large
  expressive oil paintings of her body to intimate, hyper-real figurative
  embroideries within odd quilts to create new realities spanning painting and
  textiles. Pettitâ€™s paintings explore the experience of PTSD and the politics
  of the body, using her own image as a vehicle to process and communicate. Her
  textile pieces capture this eerie experience using disjointed compositions and
  mixed materials, disembodied figures, and contrast between representational
  embroideries and cartoonish environments.
