short_bio: Based in Los Angeles, **Lauren Bon** is an environmental artist and
  her practice, Metabolic Studio, explores self-sustaining and self-diversifying
  systems of exchange that feed emergent properties that regenerate the life
  web. Works include _Not A Cornfield_, which transformed and revived an
  industrial brownfield in downtown LA into a 32-acre cornfield and _100 Mules
  Walking the Los Angeles Aqueduct_, a 240-mile performative action that aimed
  to reconnect the city of LA with the source of its water for the centenary of
  the opening of the LA Aqueduct. Her studio’s current work, _Bending the River
  Back into the City_, aims to utilize LA’s first private water right to deliver
  106-acre feet of water annually from the LA River to over 50 acres of land in
  the historic core of downtown LA.
