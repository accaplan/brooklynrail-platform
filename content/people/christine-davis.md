short_bio: "New York and Toronto based artist and editor **Christine Davis**
  describes her creative process as “speculative infection.” Colliding different
  forms of knowledge, her work explores a dynamic range of techniques to reflect
  upon the historical relation between scientific and aesthetic abstraction. She
  is a founding editor of the international journal, _Public:
  Art/Culture/Ideas_. Exhibiting since 1987, public venues include: The Power
  Plant (Toronto), Kunsthalle Munich, Haus am Waldsee (Berlin), Kunsthalle
  Bielefeld, Seoul Museum of Art, Musée de beaux arts de Montreal, Art Gallery
  of Ontario, New Museum (New York), CREDEC (Paris), and Le Confort Moderne
  (Poitiers). Publications on her work include monographs by CREDAC (Paris),
  MACM (Montreal), AGO (Toronto), and The Polygon (Vancouver)."
