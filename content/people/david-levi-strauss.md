short_bio: "David Levi Strauss is one of the most urgent and critical art
  writers working today.⁠ David Levi Strauss’s work focuses on the intersection
  between image and text, and the third space that is created through that
  interaction. His published works include Manoeuvres: Poems 1977-1979, Between
  Dog & Wolf: Essays on Art & Politics, Between the Eyes: Essays on Photography
  and Politics, From Head to Hand: Art and the Manual, Words Not Spent Today Buy
  Smaller Images Tomorrow: Essays on the Present and Future of Photography. He
  also founded and co-edited ACTS: A Journal of New Writing. His latest work is
  Co-illusion: Dispatches from the End of Communication, published March 6,
  exposing a new “iconopolitics,” in which words and images lose their
  connection to reality.⁠"
