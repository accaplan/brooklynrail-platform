short_bio: "One of the most urgent and critical art writers working today,
  **David Levi Strauss's** work focuses on the intersection between image and
  text, and the third space that is created through that interaction. He is the
  author of *Between the Eyes: Essays on Photography and Politics* (Aperture,
  2012), *Words Not Spent Today Buy Smaller Images Tomorrow: Essays on the
  Present and Future of Photography* (Aperture, 2014), and other books. His
  latest work is *Co-Illusion: Dispatches from the End of Communication* (MIT
  Press, 2020) exposing a new 'iconopolitics' in which words and images lose
  their connection to reality.‚Å†"
