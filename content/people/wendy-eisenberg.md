short_bio: "Improvising guitarist, banjo-player, vocalist, and poet **Wendy
  Eisenberg** uses free jazz, new music, metal, and art song to challenge the
  demands placed on a guitar and a banjo in contemporary music. Wendy’s debut
  record as an improviser, _Its Shape Is Your Touch_, came out in October 2018.
  Her trio, _The Machinic Unconscious_, with Ches Smith and Trevor Dunn,
  released their debut album that same month. Both records made Billboard’s
  Critic’s Choice Top Ten Jazz Records year end list. They have written and
  performed in projects including the experimental band Birthing Hips and rock
  trio Editrix. Their writing can be found in John Zorn’s _Arcana VIII:
  Musicians on Music_, Sound American Ed. 23, and in the _Contemporary Music
  Review_."
