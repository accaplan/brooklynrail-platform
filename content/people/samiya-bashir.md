short_bio: "Samiya Bashirâ€™s books of poetry: Field Theories, Gospel, and Where
  the Apple Falls, and anthologies, including Role Call: A Generational
  Anthology of Social & Political Black Literature & Art, exist. Sometimes she
  makes poems of dirt. Sometimes zeros and ones. Sometimes variously rendered
  text. Sometimes light. She lives in Portland, Ore, with a magic cat who shares
  her obsession with trees and blackbirds and occasionally crashes her classes
  and poetry salons at Reed College. "
