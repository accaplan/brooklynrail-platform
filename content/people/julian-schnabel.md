short_bio: The multidisciplinary practice of artist and director **Julian
  Schnabel** (b. 1951, Brooklyn, NY) extends beyond painting to include
  sculpture, film, architecture, and furniture. In 1978, he began to make Plate
  Paintings, imagic works with sculptural surfaces produced by layering shards
  of broken dishes with thick applications of auto body putty, dental plaster,
  and oil paint on wooden structures. His unorthodox, highly experimental
  approach to use of materials, gestures, and form and large scale and shaped
  paintings have blurred the distinction between abstraction and figuration.
  Throughout his practice, he sustained the use of objet trouv√© and chance-based
  processes, transforming painting and opening the door for new generations of
  young painters today.
