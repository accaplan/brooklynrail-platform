short_bio: "Writer and communist geographer **Phil Neel** is based in the
  Pacific Northwest. His dissertation _Global China, Global Crisis: Falling
  Profitability, Rising Capital Exports and the Formation of New Territorial
  Industrial Complexes_ is based on a decade of research spanning early work in
  the logistics suburbs of Seattle in the US, continued through field work in
  the “urban villages” and factory districts of China’s Pearl River Delta, and a
  survey of the emergent industrial zones of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This
  research involved interviews with workers across the world in English,
  Chinese, and Swahili, paired with an in-depth, critical quantitative analysis
  of data on profitability, investment, and industrial relocation in China as
  well as Chinese investment abroad. "
