short_bio: "Photographer and performance artist **Liz Cohen** focuses on the
  intersections of immigration, industry, labor and women’s representation in
  popular media. Cohen is best known for her BODYWORK project, in which she
  simultaneously transformed an East German Trabant into an American El Camino
  lowrider while inhabiting a new identity herself as a car customizer and
  bikini model. Through this immersive series, Cohen produced a body of work
  that challenges American cultural norms as they pertain to the eroticization
  of the automobile industry as well as the challenging role of women’s bodies
  in that space. In 2020, Cohen received a Guggenheim Fellowship. She is the
  subject of a solo exhibition at the Arizona State University Art Museum,
  Tempe, “Body/Magic: Liz Cohen,” through May 29, 2021."
