short_bio: Artist **Kambui Olujimi** was born and raised in Bedford Stuyvesant,
  Brooklyn. He received his MFA from Columbia University School of the Arts and
  is a graduate of Parson's School of Design and the Skowhegan School of
  Painting and Sculpture. Olujimi works within the realm of ideas rather than
  within an exclusive medium. Although he has directed a great deal of work in
  film, his is truly a multi-media practice. He crafts potent social commentary
  from delicate wisps of myth and whimsy mixed with real-world narrative.
  Lyrical and elliptical rather than ideological, Olujimiâ€™s art transcends the
  political sphere, affirming its own autonomy.
