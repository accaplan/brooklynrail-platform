short_bio: Artist **Ian Cheng**'s work explores the nature of mutation and the
  capacity of humans to relate to change. Drawing on principles of video game
  design, improvisation, and cognitive science, Cheng has produced a series of
  simulations exploring an agent’s capacity to deal with an ever-evolving
  environment. These works culminated in the _Emissaries_ trilogy, which
  introduced a narrative agent whose motivation to enact a story was set into
  conflict with the open-ended chaos of the simulation. Most recently, he has
  developed BOB (Bag of Beliefs), an AI creature whose personality, body, and
  life story evolve across exhibitions, what Cheng calls “art with a nervous
  system.
