short_bio: 'Fred Tomaselli (born 1956, Santa Monica, CA) draws upon art
  historical sources and Eastern and Western decorative traditions. His works
  explode in mesmerizing patterns that appear to grow organically across his
  compositions. In the introduction to a 2003 essay on Tomaselli’s work in
  Parkett magazine, curator James Rondeau writes: “Over the course of the last
  ten years, Fred Tomaselli has established an international reputation for his
  meticulously crafted, richly detailed, deliriously beautiful works of both
  abstract and figurative art.  His signature pieces are compelling, hybrid
  objects: ersatz, or maybe surrogate paintings, or tapestries, or quilts or
  mosaics."'
