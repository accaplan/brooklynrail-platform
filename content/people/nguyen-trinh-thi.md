short_bio: "Based in Hanoi, **Nguyễn Trinh Thi** is a filmmaker and artist.
  Traversing boundaries between film, documentary, video art, installation, and
  performance, her practice currently explores the potential of sound and
  listening, and the multiple relations between the image, sound, and space with
  ongoing interests in history, memory, ecology, representation, and the
  unknown. Recent exhibitions include installations at documenta 15, the
  Minneapolis Institute of Art, the 9th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary
  Art, the 21st Biennale of Sydney, and the 13th Lyon Contemporary Art Biennale.
  In 2009, Nguyễn founded Hanoi DOCLAB, an independent center for documentary
  film and moving image in Hanoi. "
