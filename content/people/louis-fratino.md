  interior spaces. Fratinoâ€™s work explores the queerness in the gestures of
  everyday life. Born in 1993, in Annapolis, MD, Louis Fratino received his BFA
  in Painting with concentration in Illustration from the Maryland Institute
  College of Art, Baltimore, MD in 2015. He is a recipient of a Fulbright
