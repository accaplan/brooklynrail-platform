short_bio: Self-taught, multidisciplinary artist **Susan Spangenberg** was
  raised in a severely dysfunctional family, which led to group homes and
  institutionalization during her teenage years. Susan’s work is
  autobiographical, commenting on her experience in the mental health system as
  well as touching upon other relevant social issues. She frequently
  incorporates text and writing in her art along with elements of spiritual
  symbols from her East Indian ancestry, samples of her psychotropic medication,
  and hand-sewn fabric throughout her work. Susan hopes to inspire generations
  of female artists to document their trauma, inequality, and identity and show
  how these realities have affected them–and to give female artists the freedom
  to speak out as she has.
