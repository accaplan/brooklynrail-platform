short_bio: Artist **Alice Hope** was named New York’s 2018 “Woman to Watch” by
  the National Museum of Women in the Arts. She holds an M.F.A. from Yale
  University and incorporates binary code, magnetism, reflectivity, and
  repetition in her compositions and continues her focus on the can tab as her
  work’s subject and material. Hope’s recent commissions include a monumental
  installation outside the Queens Museum incorporating more than a million used
  can tabs, and an installation with marine netting and thousands of used can
  tabs for the new United States Embassy lobby in Maputo, Mozambique, which she
  will be installing this summer.
