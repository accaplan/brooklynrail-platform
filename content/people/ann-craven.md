short_bio: "(b. 1967, Boston, MA) is known for her lush, serial portraits of the
  moon, birds, and flowers, as well as her painted bands of color. After
  completing each work, she dates and titles each palette, rendering it a unique
  and isolated index of her process. Craven’s predilection for the copy is both
  an homage to Pop Art and an exploration of remembrance. As she explains, “My
  paintings are a result of mere observation, experiment, and chance, and
  contain a variable that is constant and ever-changing--the moment just past.”
  Craven presented her first retrospective, titled TIME and curated by Yann
  Chevalier, at Le Confort Moderne in Poitiers, France in 2014. Recent solo
  exhibitions include Shane Campbell Gallery, Chicago (2019); Karma, New York
  (2018); among others. "
