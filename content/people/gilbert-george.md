short_bio: "**Gilbert & George** (b. 1943, San Martin de Tor, Italy & 1942,
  Plymouth, United Kingdom) met in 1967 in art school at Saint Martin’s, where
  they first developed their signature form of “living sculptures” by walking
  the streets of London with their heads and hands coated with multi-color
  metallic powders. Since then, they have lived and worked together, their
  individual identities subsumed into a vision of animate sculpture. Recent solo
  exhibitions of their work have been organized at Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt,
  Germany (2021); Kunsthalle Zürich, Switzerland (2020); and Astrup Fearnley
  Museet, Oslo, Norway (2019). They have received numerous awards, including the
  South Bank Award and The Lorenzo il Magnifico Award in 2007; and most notably,
  the Turner Prize in 1986. "
