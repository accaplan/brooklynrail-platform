short_bio: Distinguished by its extraordinary sensitivity to the energy and
  sensuality of the natural world, **JoAnn Verburg**’s photographic work
  combines exquisite color, varied focus, and thoughtful composition to convey
  the beauty of its subject and setting. From 1977 to 1979, she served as the
  Research Director and Photographer for the Rephotographic Survey Project,
  traveling throughout the American West to replicate the same wilderness views
  made by 19th century frontier photographers. While heading Polaroid’s Visiting
  Artist Program in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Verburg promoted technical
  innovation in the photographic field by inviting artists Chuck Close, Andy
  Warhol, William Wegman, and Jim Dine, among others, to experiment with new
  large format instant cameras.
