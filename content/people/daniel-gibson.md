short_bio: Born in Yuma, AZ in 1977, artist **Daniel Gibson** grew up in El
  Centro, CA, and other surrounding towns that border Mexicali, Baja California.
  His early inspiration came from the exposure to the desert and communities,
  raised at a sheet rock factory in Plaster City, CA, where his father worked.
  Gibsonâ€™s output is bred by his indispensable draw towards creation, an
  expressive therapeutic flow of visions and beliefs, real life situations and
  dreams, comprising a combination of elements incomparably extricated and
  productively gifted. He currently lives and works in Los Angeles, CA.
