short_bio: Using paper and intricate folds, **Yasi Alipour** explores systems of
  math and history. In her series _As Dreams Become History_, for example,
  Alipour asked Iranian friends born after the revolution to share secondhand
  memories of that decade shared by family and older friends. These texts she
  paired with sheets of paper printed with black ink and then folded into
  geometric tessellations referencing Middle Eastern abstraction. Her practice
  spans sculpture, installation, performance, drawing, writing, lectures, and
  experimentation and probes personal history to parse issues around political
  instability and interrupted histories. Her artistic practice is founded on the
  lived experience of a Middle Eastern queer and a citizen with a politically
  unhinged society and an interrupted history.
