short_bio: Artist and musician **Clara Joy** released her first album at 15,
  earning a fast growing indie reputation. Her latest single, “We’re Not All In
  This Together,” a political Gen Z anthem, recently went viral on TikTok in
  support of streaming the song to help donate to trans youth. Her latest debut,
  a short feature called “Part of Something” by Sophia Johnson, documents the
  young Clara Joy as she shares tips for musicians searching for venues, and
  disrupts the conventional music tropes of band culture.
