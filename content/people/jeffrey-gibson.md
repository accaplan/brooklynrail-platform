short_bio: Jeffrey Gibson (b. 1972, Colorado Springs, CO) grew up in major urban
  centers in the United States, Germany, Korea, and England. He received a
  Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the School of the Art Institute of
  Chicago in 1995 and Master of Arts in painting at the Royal College of Art,
  London, in 1998. He is a citizen of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians
  and is half Cherokee. Jeffrey Gibsonâ€™s multimedia practice synthesizes the
  cultural and artistic traditions of his Cherokee and Choctaw heritage with the
  visual languages of Modernism and themes from contemporary popular and queer
  culture. His work is a vibrant call for queer and Indigenous empowerment,
  envisioning a celebration of strength and joy within these communities.
