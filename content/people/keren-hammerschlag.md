short_bio: "The research of **Keren Hammerschlag** focuses on nineteenth-century
  British art and visual culture, and the intersections and frictions between
  art and medicine during the Victorian and Edwardian periods. In 2010 she
  received her PhD in Art History from the Courtauld Institute of Art,
  University of London. Her current book project, _The Colour of Empire:
  Representing Race in Victorian Painting_, considers the ways Victorian
  painters both affirmed and challenged racial boundaries through the creative
  use of pigment. In 2021, Hammerschlag was awarded a four-year ANU Futures
  Scheme Award to develop the Visual Medical Humanities at the ANU. She is
  Senior Lecturer in Art History and Curatorship in the Centre for Art History
  and Curatorship at the Australian National University in Canberra."
