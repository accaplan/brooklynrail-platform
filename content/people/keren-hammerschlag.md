short_bio: "The researech of **Keren Hammerschlag** focuses on
  nineteenth-century British art and visual culture, and the many intersections
  and frictions between art and medicine during the Victorian and Edwardian
  periods. She has a particular interest in questions of gender and race in
  Victorian anatomical illustration. In 2010 she received her PhD in Art History
  from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. Her current book
  project, 'The Colour of Empire: Representing Race in Victorian Painting,'
  considers the ways Victorian painters both affirmed and challenged racial
  boundaries through the creative use of pigment. In 2021 Hammerschlag was
  awarded a four-year ANU Futures Scheme Award to develop the Visual Medical
  Humanities at the ANU."
