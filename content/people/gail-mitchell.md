short_bio: A poet and jeweler by trade, **Gail Mitchell** is a native of San
  Francisco with roots from New Orleans and Oklahoma. Early loss of her mother
  provided the emotional foundation for writing that shares her joys and grief,
  through her narratives of alternative historical perspectives. With a Masters
  degree from San Francisco State University, she has worked with several former
  San Francisco Poet Laureates, most recently, Jack Hirschman, in his anthology,
  _Building Socialism Fighting Fascism_ (Homeward Press, 2021). Her book _Bone
  Songs_ (Taurean Horn Press, 1999) has been used as a textbook by poet, author,
  teacher and artist Troung Tran in his undergraduate writing course at San
  Francisco State.
