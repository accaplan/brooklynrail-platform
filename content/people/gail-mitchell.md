short_bio: A poet and jeweler by trade, **Gail Mitchell** is a native of San
  Francisco with roots from New Orleans and Oklahoma. Early loss of her mother
  provided the emotional foundation for writing that shares her joys and grief,
  through her narratives of alternative historical perspectives. With a Masters
  degree from San Francisco State University, she has worked with several former
  San Francisco Poet Laureates, most recently, Jack Hirschman, in his anthology,
  _Building Socialism Fighting Fascism_. Her book _Bone Songs_ (1999), published
  by Taurean Horn Press, has been used by poet, author, teacher and artist
  Troung Tran, as a textbook in his undergraduate writing course at SF State
  University.
