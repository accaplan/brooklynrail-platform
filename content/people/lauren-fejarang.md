short_bio: "A Los Angeles-based artist working primarily in sculpture and
  collage. Fejarang’s sculptures utilize materials such as concrete and paper,
  to address questions around contradicting sensations that impinge the body.
  Fejarang’s work finds power in its relationship to the human form—the artist
  engages unlikely materials to create markers and sculptural records. Her
  collage work also addresses the body, but in a two-dimensional format that
  allows viewers to see flesh as material reconfigured. Fejarang received her
  MFA from Art Center College of Design in 2013. "
