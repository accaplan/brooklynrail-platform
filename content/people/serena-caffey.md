short_bio: Transdisciplinary artist Serena Caffrey investigates time, longing,
  and land-body relationality. Embodiment is the creative hub of their practice,
  and her drawings, prints, text-based works, and collaborative, experimental
  films synthesize movement-based research that ranges from performative to
  athletic. Together these gestures question the im/possibility of settler
  belonging, otherworldliness, and the sublime.
