short_bio: Artist **Julia Rommel** (b. 1980, Salisbury, Maryland) is an American
  painter with a strong interest in the art historical canon. In her paintings,
  Rommel is less interested in signature brush strokes than in what she
  describes as using tools “to keep my signature away”. Her paintings act
  equally as research into color. While they are not attempts at color
  harmonies, the artist is interested in the conflict between colors and of
  using tones to eliminate one another. Rommel’s work acts between painting and
  relief, insisting on the objectiveness of the work.
