short_bio: "Peruvian-American artist and scholar **Suzanne Herrera Li Puma** is
  interested in what a decolonial, feminist mark-making practice might feel
  like, particularly the experience of writing on the edge of the sayable:
  illegible scrawls, almost nothings, and the nearly inanimate. Her work has
  been exhibited nationally and internationally, and she is a contributor to
  _Contemporary Print Handbook_ (Halmos Press, 2016). Herrera Li Puma is a
  doctoral student at U.C. Berkeley. In 2021, she received an ACLS Leading Edge
  Fellowship, a program that aims to demonstrate the potential of people with
  advanced degrees in the humanities and humanistic social sciences to solve
  problems outside the academy. She lives and works in California and New York."
