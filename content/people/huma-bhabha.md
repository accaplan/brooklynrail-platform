short_bio: Themes of memory, war, displacement, and the pervasive histories of
  colonialism can be found in the work of **Huma Bhabha**. Using found materials
  and the detritus of everyday life, she creates haunting human figures that
  hover between abstraction and figuration, monumentality and entropy. While her
  formal vocabulary is distinctly her own, Bhabha embraces a postmodern
  hybridity that spans centuries, geography, art historical traditions, and
  cultural associations. Her work includes references to ancient Greek Kouroi,
  Gandharan Buddhas, African sculpture, and Egyptian reliquary. At the same
  time, it remains insistently modern, looking to Giacometti, Picasso, and
  Rauschenberg for inspiration, as well as to science fiction, horror movies,
  and popular novels.
