short_bio: Allowing the act of drawing to organically dictate his compositions
  in works that range from intimate drawings to large scale murals, **Hugo
  Crosthwaite** juxtaposes a wide range of textural and tonal ranges against
  spaces that alternate from dense and atmospheric to flat and graphic. His
  subjects—the everyday men, women and children that populate the border region
  of San Diego/Tijuana—are presented in a non-idealized documentary style.
  Crosthwaite is the 2019 winner of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery
  Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. He was born 1971 in Tijuana and spent
  his formative years in Rosarito, Mexico. An American citizen with family on
  both sides of the border, he lives and works in San Diego, CA and Rosarito,
  Mexico.
