short_bio: Gordon Knox is an educator, cultural innovator, and institution
  builder. Knox's work relocates the critical, disciplined investigation and
  knowledge production of art and art-making back to the core of social
  interpretation and cultural transformation. His primary means of accomplishing
  this is by conceptualizing and building effective cultural institutions that
  support artists as agents of social change suspended in a global network of
  public intellectuals, educators, and creative practitioners of all sorts. Knox
  has served as president of the San Francisco Art Institute, Director of the
  Arizona State University Art Museum, and as a core collaborator at the
  Stanford Humanities Lab.
