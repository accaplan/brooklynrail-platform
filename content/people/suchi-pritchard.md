short_bio: NY/Hornby Island(B.C.)-based writer and visual artist **Suchi J
  Pritchard** is presently at work on a bildungsroman manuscript exploring the
  setting of supersize malls & identities formed whilst searching for the
  sublime amidst the necropastoral of eroding public space.  A long-time student
  of silent monk Baba Hari Dass, and more currently a student of Vipassana
  meditation in the tradition of Ajahn Tong, Suchi is delighted to join this
  conversation.
