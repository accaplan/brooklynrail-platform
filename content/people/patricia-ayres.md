short_bio: "Combining her background in fashion design with sculpture,
  **Patricia Ayres**’s practice draws on themes of transgression and punishment.
  Using familial histories involving the structures and symbols of organized
  religion and the US penal system, Ayres analyzes how the body may be
  constrained physically and psychologically. Ayres holds an MFA from Hunter
  College, a BFA from Brooklyn College, and an Associate’s Degree from the
  Fashion Institute of Technology. Her work has been included in recent
  exhibitions at Koenig & Clinton Gallery, Thomas Hunter, and the International
  Print Center. She has participated in residencies at MASS MoCA, Takt
  Kunstprojektraum, and Sculpture Space (Utica). "
