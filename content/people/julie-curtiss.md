short_bio: "French artist based in Brooklyn **Julie Curtiss** focuses on the
  relationship between nature and culture in her figurative painting, sculpture,
  and gouache on paper, exposing and reworking female archetypes through a
  surrealist sense of the uncanny. Through the use of unexpected juxtapositions,
  of subject with object, of the seen and the implied, and an exaggerated
  portrayal of cartoon-like forms, her paintings are infused with a direct and
  deadpan humor, revealing the uncanny within the banal and the grotesque and
  surreal undertones of human characteristics and behavior. "
