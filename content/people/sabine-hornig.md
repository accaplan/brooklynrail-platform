short_bio: The sculptures, photographs and installations of **Sabine Hornig**
  re-envision architectural spaces and ubiquitous urban forms to explore the
  concepts of space, perspective and memory. At once rigorously formal and
  poetic, her work recontextualizes familiar places and structures such asÂ­
  storefront windows, urban facades, and school houses through overlapping
  perspectives and inversions of scale and dimension.  Throughout the past two
  decades, Hornig has presented numerous solo exhibitions of her work as well as
  large architectual interventions in public spaces worldwide, including a
  site-specific installation commissioned by the Public Art Fund at LaGuardia
  Airport in New York (2020).
