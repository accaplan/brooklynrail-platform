short_bio: "Martha Tuttle, a multidisciplinary artist born in Santa Fe, New
  Mexico, has shown her work throughout the U.S. and abroad. Natural materials
  of wool, silk, and dye are worked by hand, each resulting piece having
  undergone an immaterial transfer of energy through Tuttle’s physical and
  meditative touch. The artist’s relationship to materiality is revealed further
  by the inclusion of small “stones,” both actual and cast polished metal, and
  of fabricated steel weights. These elements add another layer of visual
  incident and mark-making, to further open a dialogue of possibility and
  substance, light, and weight. Overall, the unification of immaterial energy
  with material form results in constructed canvases and loosely hanging
  paintings that vibrate with a felt, unseen force. "
