short_bio: "**Andrés Mario Zervigón** is Associate Professor of the History of
  Photography at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. His work focuses
  upon moments in history when these media prove inadequate to their task of
  representation. Zervigón's first book, _John Heartfield and the Agitated
  Image: Photography, Persuasion, and the Rise of Avant-Garde Photomontage_
  (University of Chicago Press, 2012) examines the Weimar-era work of this
  German artist and the crisis of photographic representation generating his
  highly political photomontage. Zervigón has published articles and reviews in
  \"New German Critique,\" \"Visual Resources,\" and \"Rundbrief Fotografie,\"
  among others, and he has contributed to catalogues for the Art Institute of
  Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "
