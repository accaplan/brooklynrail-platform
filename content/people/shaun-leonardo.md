short_bio: Shaun Leonardo’s multidisciplinary work negotiates societal
  expectations of manhood, namely definitions surrounding black and brown
  masculinities, along with its notions of achievement, collective identity, and
  experience of failure. His performance practice, anchored by his work in
  Assembly – a diversion program for court-involved youth at the Brooklyn-based,
  non-profit Recess, is participatory and invested in a process of embodiment.
  Leonardo is a Brooklyn-based artist from Queens, New York City. His work has
  been featured at The Guggenheim Museum, the High Line, and New Museum, with a
  recent solo exhibition at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). From fall
  2018 through spring 2020, Leonardo enacted socially engaged projects at Pratt
  Institute as the School of Art, Visiting Fellow.
