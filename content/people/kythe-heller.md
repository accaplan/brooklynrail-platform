short_bio: "Poet, essayist, performer, filmmaker, and scholar **Kythe Heller**
  is based in Cambridge, MA. In mixed-genre poems, essays, and pieces for
  collaborative and solo performance, Heller experiments poetics practices that
  re-orient art-making as a practice of consciousness: In what ways can our
  writings become sites of resistance, sites of evolution, parts of realizing
  new social and ecological relationships? She is the author of the poetry
  collection _Firebird_ (Arrowsmith, 2020), and her chapbooks, _Immolation_
  (Monk Honey), was a finalist for the Walt McDonald First Book Prize from Texas
  Tech UP. Currently she is a poet on the faculty of the Language and Thinking
  Program at Bard College and pursuing a doctoral degree in Comparative Religion
  at Harvard University."
