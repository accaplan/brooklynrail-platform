short_bio: Artist **Joan Semmel** (b.1932) began her painting career in the
  1960s while living in Madrid as an Abstract Expressionist, exhibiting in Spain
  and South America. Returning to New York in 1970, she moved to figuration in
  response to pornography and concerns around representation of women in the
  culture. Her practice traces the transformation that womenâ€™s sexuality has
  seen in the last century and emphasizes the possibility for female autonomy
  through the body. Her work has been widely exhibited and is in the collections
  of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los
  Angeles, CA; Tate, London, United Kingdom, the Brooklyn Museum, NY; and The
  Dallas Museum, TX; among many others.
