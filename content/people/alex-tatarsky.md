short_bio: "A 2017-18 Movement Research Artist-in-Residence, **Alexandra
  Tatarsky** makes work in the unfortunate in-between zone of comedy, poetry,
  dance-theater and deluded rant, sometimes with songs. They have performed
  their own work and the work of others at La Mama, MoMa PS1, 47 Canal, New
  Museum, The Kitchen, and the Brooklyn Museum, among many others. Chapbooks
  include _Vacant Love (love letters for vacant lots)_ and _Embrace the Tree (on
  pagan metal and neo-fascist fantasies)_. As the Shanzhai Lyric, they publish
  mini-compilations of bootleg t-shirt poems. Writings on hyper-capitalism,
  nonsense, and mimes are forthcoming in _ArtReview Asia_, _Folder_, and
  _Garlands_. "
