short_bio: "An experimental filmmaker, curator, author, educator **MM Serra**
  Executive Director of Film-Makers Cooperative, the oldest and largest archive
  of independent media in the world. Her first five films (NYC, 1985, Nightfall,
  1984, Framed, 1984, PPI, 1986, Turner, 1987) were preserved and digitized by
  Anthology Film Archives Preservation series Re-Visions: American Experimental
  Film 1975-1990. The series “spotlights…the generation of experimental film
  artists who emerged after the final formation in 1975 of AFA’s Essential
  Cinema repertory screening cycle.” Anthology describes Serra’s five films as a
  “DIY Lower East Side spirit, but introduces a distinctive lyrical eroticism.”"
