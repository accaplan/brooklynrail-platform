short_bio: "Experimental filmmaker, curator, author, and educator **MM Serra**
  is the Executive Director of The Film-Makers' Cooperative, the oldest and
  largest archive of independent media in the world. Her first five films
  (_NYC_,1985; _Nightfall_, 1984; _Framed_, 1984; _PPI_, 1986; and _Turner_,
  1987) were preserved and digitized by the Anthology Film Archives Preservation
  series _Re-Visions: American Experimental Film 1975-1990_. The series
  “spotlights…the generation of experimental film artists who emerged after the
  final formation in 1975 of AFA’s Essential Cinema repertory screening cycle.”
  Anthology describes Serra’s five films as a “DIY Lower East Side spirit, but
  introduces a distinctive lyrical eroticism.”"
