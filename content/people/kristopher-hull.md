short_bio: Raised in Kenya and Greece, **Kristopher Hull** and attended the
  architecture school at Rice University, which he left early to attempt a
  career as a self-taught concert pianist. Finding pianos wherever he could,
  practicing up to ten hours a day. In 2008, inspired by his hero Don Quixote,
  he loaded an upright piano into the back of a pickup truck and drove from
  Miami to Denver committing pianist errantry, performing and bringing Chopin to
  those in need. He practiced like a madman throughout the pandemic, convinced
  it would be time to ride once again when the world opened back up.
