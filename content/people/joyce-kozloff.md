short_bio: Artist **Joyce Kozloff** is considered a major figure in both the
  Pattern and Decoration and the Feminist art movements of the 1970s, and since
  the early 1990s, she has utilized mapping as a structure for layering multiple
  meanings and examining the ways that information is communicated. Her artistic
  practice aims to fuse widespread cultural traditions, including applied and
  decorative arts, with an activist temperament. She charts physical and
  diplomatic terrain, creating places, real and imagined, to dramatize the
  intersections of culture and politics. Kozloff has also completed 18 public
  artworks in the US and abroad, most recently _Memory and Time_, a GSA
  commission at the federal courthouse in Greenville, SC opening to the public
  on August 16.
