short_bio: "A major figure in the Pattern and Decoration and Feminist art
  movements of the 1970s, artist **Joyce Kozloff** has utilized mapping as a
  device for consolidating her enduring interests in history, culture, and the
  decorative and popular arts since the 1990s. She initially concentrated on
  cities known to her, onto which patterns and images reflecting their colonial
  pasts were then overlaid. Kozloff has been included in several international
  museum exhibitions, including _With Pleasure: Pattern and Decoration in
  American Art 1972-1985_, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2019-2020)
  and _Less is a Bore: Maximalist Art & Design_, Institute for Contemporary Art,
  Boston (2019), among others. Her current exhibit _Uncivil Wars_ is on view at
  DC Moore Gallery, New York through August 13."
