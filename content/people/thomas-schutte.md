short_bio: "Artist **Thomas Schütte** was born in Oldenburg, Germany in 1954 and
  studied at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he received instruction from
  Gerhard Richter and Daniel Buren. Since the mid-1980s, figuration has been a
  central concern for the artist; his use of figure and representation of the
  body coincided with a general return to the themes of narrative and allegory
  in art in the 1980s—a period in which theatricality was a prevalent political,
  social, and cultural mode. Schütte’s works present what the artist has
  referred to as “the grammar of character,” as opposed to a mere representation
  of the psychological. His current exhibition at Peter Freeman, Inc. is on view
  through November 6, 2021. "
