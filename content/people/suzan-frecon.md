short_bio: 'Suzan Frecon is known for abstract oil paintings and works on paper.
  Her work embodies the durational activity of painting itself and invites the
  viewer’s sustained attention: these, she says, “are not pictures that you look
  at. They are paintings that you experience." In Frecon’s paintings,
  composition serves as a foundational structure, holding color, material, and
  light. Her compositions are characterized by asymmetrically balanced forms in
  precise spatial and proportional relationships. The artist mixes pigments and
  oils to differing effects, and her almost tactile use of color and contrasting
  matte and shiny surfaces heightens the visual experience of her work. '
