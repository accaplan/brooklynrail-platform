short_bio: Multidisciplinary artist **Emilio Rojas** works primarily with the
  body in performance, using video, photography, installation, public
  interventions and sculpture. As a queer latinx immigrant with indigenous
  heritage, he engages in the postcolonial ethical imperative to uncover,
  investigate, and make known undervalued or disparaged sites of knowledge,
  narratives, and individuals. He utilizes his body as an instrument to unearth
  removed traumas, embodied forms of decolonization, migration and poetics of
  space. His research based practice is influenced by queer and feminist
  archives, border politics, botanical colonialism, and defaced monuments. He is
  also a translator, community activist, yoga teacher, and anti-oppression
  facilitator with queer, migrant, and refugee youth.
