short_bio: "Painter, video, and installation artist **Samantha Nye** lives in
  Philadelphia. For the first decade of her life, she was a relatively
  unsuccessful child model. She learned early about performance, identity, and
  class aspiration. Her work reframes seduction through reenactments of 1960s
  pop culture. Her paintings, videos, and installations highlight aging bodies,
  celebrate queer kinship, and facilitate an intergenerational dialogue about
  sexuality, leisure, and pleasure. Her recent solo show,  _My Heartâ€™s In A
  Whirl_  at The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston was written about in _BOMB
  Magazine_,  _The Brooklyn Rail_, and other publications. She has a painting in
  the collection of The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston which is on display in the
  group show,  _New Light: Encounters and Connections._"
