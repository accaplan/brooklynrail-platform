short_bio: Artist **James Clar** (Filipino-American b. 1979, USA) studied Film
  and Animation at New York University and received his Masters from NYUâ€™s
  Interactive Telecommunications Program. His work explores the conceptual and
  narrative potential of light and technology. These systems are integrated into
  our daily lives, altering the way we receive information and communicate. They
  inform our perception of reality, time, and space. Every system for
  communication enhances certain types of information while limiting and
  simplifying others. These modulated effects to our perception have become a
  thematic focus to his works and a way to experiment with narrative forms.
