short_bio: Brad Kahlhamer is an artist known for his multi-media practice,
  ranging from sculpture and painting to performance and music. He is currently
  based in New York City, working from his studio in Brooklyn. Major influences
  that appear throughout his work are informed by a lifetime of multi-ethnic and
  street culture explorations. Kahlhamer questions notions of authenticity and
  representation within a very specific discourse of Native American art. His
  work has been collected by institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, the
  Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Denver Art
  Museum, the Milwaukee Art Museum, and the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art,
  Seattle Art Museum, the Hood Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of
  Modern Art among others.
