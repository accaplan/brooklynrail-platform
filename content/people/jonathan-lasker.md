short_bio: "Since the 1980s, artist **Jonathan Lasker** has transformed a visual
  language inherited from modernism into a syntax all his own, making paintings
  that exert both analytical rigor and an undeniably visceral appeal. _Born
  Yesterday_, his first solo exhibition with Greene Naftali, spans four decades
  from Lasker’s early career to the present, occasioning new interpretations of
  his singular brand of abstraction and its lasting impact on generations of
  artists. Solo exhibitions of his work have been held at the Museo Nacional
  Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen,
  Düsseldorf; The Power Plant Contemporary Art Center, Toronto; Stedelijk
  Museum, Amsterdam; and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, among
  others. "
