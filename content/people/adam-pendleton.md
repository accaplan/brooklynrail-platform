short_bio: Artist **Adam Pendleton’s** multidisciplinary practice uses text,
  gesture, and appropriated imagery to reconsider social resistance, avant-garde
  art, and underrepresented historical movements. Across silkscreen paintings,
  photographic collage, video, performance, and publishing, Pendleton filters
  ideas and aesthetics from the Black Arts Movement, Minimalism, Conceptualism,
  and Dada through a graphic, monochromatic palette. Pendleton describes his
  work as “Black Dada,” a phrase coined by the poet Amiri Baraka. He has
  exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Seoul, and Johannesburg. His
  work belongs in the collections of the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum
  and Sculpture Garden, the Long Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
  the Museum of Modern Art, and the Tate.
