  She is an art writer and hobby cartoodlist who writes “with” rather than “on”
  contemporary art and artists. Her interests range across art as a “structure
  of feeling”, human/nonhuman animal ontologies, the natural fantastic, the
  aesthetics of wonder, theories and practices of writing, the interview as
  essay, the history of modernism(s), surrealist methodologies, dystopias and
  utopias, and the metaphysics of technology. She has published in The Brooklyn
  Rail, Art Agenda, Artforum, Art in America, and numerous artist’s catalogs.
  She has a Masters in Cinema Studies from NYU, and a PhD from The History of
  Consciousness Program at UC Santa Cruz. "
