short_bio: An Iranian visual artist who lives in New York City, known primarily
  for her work in film, video and photography. Her artwork centers on the
  contrasts between Islam and the West, femininity and masculinity, public life
  and private life, antiquity and modernity, and bridging the spaces between
  these subjects. Neshatâ€™s earliest works were photographs exploring notions of
  femininity in relation to Islamic fundamentalism and militancy in her home
  country. Her subsequent video works utilized poetic imagery and narratives.
  Her first video installations utilize dual video screens to portray abstract
  oppositions based around gender and society. She has collaborated with Philip
  Glass and many others. She has been featured in solo exhibitions and film
  festivals all over the world.
