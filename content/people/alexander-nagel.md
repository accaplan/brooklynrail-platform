short_bio: "Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU **Alexander Nagel's**
  interest in art and religious reform produced _Michelangelo and the Reform of
  Art_ (2000, winner of the Renaissance Society of America’s Gordan book prize),
  and _The Controversy of Renaissance Art_ (2011, winner of the College Art
  Association’s Morey book prize). His interest in the multiple temporalities of
  art led to the publication of _Anachronic Renaissance_ (co-authored with
  Christopher Wood, 2010) and _Medieval Modern: Art out of Time_ (2012). His
  current work addresses questions of orientation and configurations of place in
  Renaissance art and culture. In 2016, he received an NEH Fellowship for a
  collaborative project (with Elizabeth Horodowich, NMSU) entitled _Amerasia: A
  Renaissance Discovery_."
