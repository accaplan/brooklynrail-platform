short_bio: Artist **Sarah Sze** makes work that strives to navigate and model
  the ceaseless proliferation of information and objects in contemporary life.
  Incorporating elements of painting, architecture, and installation within her
  sculpture, Sze investigates the value we place on objects and explores how
  objects ascribe meaning to the places and times we inhabit. Like the
  scientific instruments of measurement they often reference, Sze's sculptures
  attempt to quantify and organize the universe, ascribing a fragile, personal
  system of order. In 2013, Sze represented the United States at the 55th Venice
  Biennale with a solo pavilion presentation entitled _Triple Point_.
