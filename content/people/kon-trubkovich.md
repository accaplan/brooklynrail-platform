short_bio: "Artist **Kon Trubkovich** uses recollection as the primary source
  material for his works on paper, paintings, and videos. Drawing from
  subconscious references, deteriorated home footage, and recorded history, his
  work reflects moments warped by both time and antiquated technology. He has
  exhibited nationally at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York, NY; Museum of
  Contemporary Art, Chicago, IL; and United Artists, Ltd., Marfa, TX; among
  others; and internationally at Kunstmuseum Bern, Bern, Switzerland; the Athens
  Biennial of Contemporary Art, Athens, Greece; and The Garage Center for
  Contemporary Sculpture, Moscow, Russia, to name a few. His work is in numerous
  permanent collections. Born in Moscow, Russia, Trubkovich lives and works in
  Brooklyn, NY. "
