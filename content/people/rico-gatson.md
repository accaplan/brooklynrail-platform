short_bio: "Over the course of almost two decades, Rico Gatson has become
  celebrated for his confrontational and politically opinionated artworks, often
  based on significant moments in black history. Images of riots, fires, and
  confinement pervade his works, which have touched on a range of subjects like
  the Watts Riots, the presidential election of Barack Obama, and the formation
  of the Black Panthers. As Gatson once said: “I’m always interested in seducing
  the viewer and then hitting them on the way out, allowing a delayed response
  to powerfully charged content.” Even though he uses painting, video, sculpture
  and installation, Gatson prefers not to be defined by any single medium,
  rather thinking of himself as an object maker inspired by Conceptualism and
  Performance Art."
