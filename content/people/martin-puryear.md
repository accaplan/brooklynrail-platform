short_bio: "Over the last five decades Martin Puryear has created a body of work
  based on abstract organic forms rich with psychological, cultural, and
  historical references. His labor-intensive sculptures are made by hand at his
  studio in upstate New York. They combine practices adapted from many different
  traditions, including wood carving, joinery, and boat building, as well as
  more recent technology. As a student, Puryear studied ornithology, falconry,
  and archery, and in the 1960s he volunteered with the Peace Corps in west
  Africa, where he educated himself in the regionâ€™s indigenous crafts. Since
  then he has continued to travel extensively, observing a range of cultures and
  their unique approaches to object making. "
