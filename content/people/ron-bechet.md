  the University of New Orleans where he earned a BA degree and went on to earn
  an MFA degree from Yale University. Since then he has exhibited his work
  nationally and internationally. He is known for intimate drawings and
  paintings inspired by the land and circumstances of  Southern  Louisiana,
  knotted and matted and within the African Diaspora tradition of trees
  connecting earth and sky, the realms of the ancestors and the living. They
