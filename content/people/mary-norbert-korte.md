short_bio: Poet, environmental activist, and teacher **Mary Norbert
  Kortë** joined the Dominican Catholic Sisterhood in San Rafael, California at
  the age of 17. She earned BA and MA degrees in Latin, translating
  Virgil’s _Georgics_ into iambic pentameter and studying classical texts. She
  left the Dominican order in 1968, and continued to publish poetry, participate
  in anti-war activism, and spearhead environmental protection
  projects—including the preservation of over 200 acres of old growth redwoods
  in Irmulco, where she moved in the 1970s. There, she served as Northern
  California Coordinator for Poets in the Schools, and taught in Coyote Valley’s
  reservation for the Pomo people and at Mendocino Community College. She still
  lives in a cabin she built herself, and writes nearly every day.
