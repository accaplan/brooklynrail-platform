short_bio: Born in Lviv, Ukraine, **Luba Drozd** is an installation artist
  working with site-specific sound, 3D animation, and sculpture. Her works are
  composed using vibrations that form sonic spaces alongside sculptural
  projections.Her pieces touch on the universeâ€™s timelessness, the
  transformation of nature, and the shifting awareness of time and matter,
  gesturing to how intangible spaces within us, such as memory, knowledge, and
  perception, are controlled and regimented. She is the recipient of many
  awards, including the NYSCA/NYFA Fellowship in Digital and Electronic Arts,
  MacDowell Fellowship, Yaddo Residency, and BRIC Media Arts Fellowship. Her
  installations are commissioned and exhibited at such institutions as the
  Hessel Museum of Art, Knockdown Center, and Bronx Museum of Art.
