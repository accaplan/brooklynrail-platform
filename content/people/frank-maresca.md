short_bio: "American art dealer **Frank Maresca** is the co-founder of
  Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New York City. A long-term advocate of Self-Taught,
  Folk, and Outsider Art, he has championed and showcased the work of artists
  creating on the margins of the art-historical mainstream for over 35 years.
  Through many gallery exhibits, museum collaborations, key publications, and
  philanthropic work, Maresca—who is currently on the advisory board of the
  Creative Growth Art Center, Raw Vision Magazine, and Fountain House
  Gallery—has sought to blur the lines that have traditionally separated
  conventional categories in visual art and vernacular art. "
