short_bio: "American art dealer **Frank Maresca** is co-founder of Ricco/Maresca
  Gallery in New York City. A long-term advocate of Self-Taught, Folk, and
  Outsider Art, he has championed and showcased the work of artists creating on
  the margins of the art-historical mainstream for over 35 years. Through many
  gallery exhibits, museum collaborations, philanthropic work, and key
  publications (including _American Primitive_, 1988, _Bill Traylor: His Art,
  His Life_, 1991, _American Self-Taught_, 1993, and _American Vernacular_,
  2002), Maresca has sought to blur the lines that have traditionally separated
  conventional categories in visual art and vernacular art. He is currently on
  the advisory board of Raw Vision Magazine, Fountain House Gallery, Intuit in
  Chicago, and the Art Dealers Association of America."
