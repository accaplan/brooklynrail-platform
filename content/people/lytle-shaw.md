short_bio: "Poet and scholar **Lytle Shaw** is a Contributing Editor of
  _Cabinet_, Founder and Co-editor of _Shark_, and Founder and Curator of the
  Line Reading Series at The Drawing Center. Among other publications, he is the
  author of _Frank Oâ€™Hara: The Poetics of Coterie_ (2006), _Fieldworks: From
  Place to Site in Postwar Poetics_ (2013), and most recently _New Grounds for
  Dutch Landscape_ (2020), which argues that the works of Jan van Goyen, Jacob
  van Ruisdael, and Meindert Hobbema do not so much represent the newly made
  landscape of seventeenth-century Holland as re-enact, through their facture,
  both the processes of its reclamation, and ongoing threats to its stability:
  drainage problems, floods, abrasion and erosion of the ground plane.  "
