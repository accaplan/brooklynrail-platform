short_bio: Born in France in 1972, **Laurent Grasso** has developed a
  fascination with the visual possibilities related to the science of
  electromagnetic energy, radio waves and naturally occurring phenomena. Grasso
  explores these sciences as they apply to paranormal activity, a favorite
  subject of 18th century scientists and philosophers, often used as parlor
  entertainment during the Victorian era.  Incorporating imagery culled from the
  cinema and art history, Grasso works in video, sculpture, painting and
  drawing, to recreate phenomena – both human and natural – that set up surreal
  and ambiguous juxtapositions of time and space. Grasso lives and works in
  Paris, France.
