short_bio: Consisting of video, sculpture, photography, artist books, and most
  recently, painted collages inspired by printmaking techniques, **Anthony
  Iacono**â€™s interdisciplinary studio practice recontextualizes quotidian
  objects, reconfiguring fruit, plants, and curtains to replace their original
  functions with those of physical pleasure and perversity. Iacono studied at
  the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and holds an MFA from Virginia
  Commonwealth University and a BFA from the School of Visual Arts. His work has
  been exhibited at P.P.O.W. Gallery, Duplex, and Zevitas Marcus. Iacono is the
  recipient of the Toby Devan Lewis Fellowship Award and the Robert M. Washburn
  Award for the Arts.
