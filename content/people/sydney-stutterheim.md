short_bio: "Art historian, curator, and writer **Sydney Stutterheim** joined
  Gagosian in 2018. Her scholarly research focuses on postwar and contemporary
  art, with a focus on performance practices of the 1970s and 80s. She is the
  co-editor of _Poetic Practical: The Unrealized Work of Chris Burden_
  (Gagosian, 2022), and is completing a book titled _Accomplices_, developed
  from her doctoral dissertation about networked authorship in the 1970s and
  80s—which features Chris Burden as one of four main case studies. She has
  lectured on Burden and other artists’ work in various contexts and currently
  serves as Gagosian’s resident art historian."
