short_bio: Performer, choreographer, and writer **Okwui Okpokwasili** creates
  multidisciplinary performance pieces that draw viewers into the interior lives
  of women of color, particularly those of African and African American women,
  whose stories have long been overlooked and rendered invisible. The child of
  immigrants from Nigeria, Okpokwasili was born and raised in the Bronx, and the
  histories of these places and the girls and women who inhabit them feature
  prominently in much of her work. Her productions bring together elements of
  dance, theater, and the visual arts, and her performance work has been
  commissioned by the Walker Art Center, Danspace Project, Performance Space New
  York, the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA, the 10th Annual Berlin
  Biennale, among other institutions.
