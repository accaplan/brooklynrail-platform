short_bio: Artist and musician **Joan Levy Hepburn** worked closely with Willem
  de Kooning until the end of his life. He was her personal mentor, and guided
  her through art degrees at Rhode Island School of Design and Kansas City Art
  Institute. Her intention in painting is to make a real physical experience,
  rather than a “picture of one.” Joan's work was represented by the Allan Stone
  Gallery from 1995-2009, until the gallery closed. She then painted her
  _Streams_ series, which became a traveling exhibition. A book published in
  2014 documents the _Streams_ exhibition of oil paintings, with text is written
  by Richard Shiff. She gives talks at museums and universities about her
  personal experiences with Willem de Kooning to promote understanding of his
  work.
