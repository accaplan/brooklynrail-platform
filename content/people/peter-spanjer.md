short_bio: "Peter Spanjer lives and works in London. His work has a layer of
  sensuality, sexuality, and a certain softness and vulnerability which can be
  traced to his personal battles with breaking away from gender identification
  within an African household, specifically as a black gay male. Spanjer strives
  to confront his own sensitivity in his work. The research is often based on
  self-evaluation: trying to dismantle narratives that have been planted and may
  still be growing. Whilst challenging an internalized belief system, Spanjer
  equally tries to pull apart generic ideas on ‘blackness’ and black men within
  the art world and what an artist who is black should display or talk about
  within their work. The theme of resistance is often a framework he tries to
  build or begin to build a workaround."
