short_bio: "Artist, poet, and curator **JoAnne McFarland** is the Artistic
  Director of Artpoetica Project Space in Gowanus, Brooklyn which focuses on
  work that is both literary and highly visual. McFarland has exhibited widely,
  both nationally and internationally, for more than thirty years. Her artwork
  is in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, the Columbus
  Museum of Art, the Department of State, and Dynegy, Inc., among many others.
  She is the author of eighteen poetry books and libretti, including a recent
  series of innovative digital bookworks. In her work McFarland treats violence
  and creativity as diametrically opposed: each act of making thwarts violenceâ€™s
  aim to destroy."
