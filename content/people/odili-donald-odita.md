short_bio: "An abstract painter whose work explores color both in the figurative
  historical context and in the sociopolitical sense. He is best known for his
  large-scale canvases with kaleidoscopic patterns and vibrant hues, which he
  uses to reflect the human condition. For Odita, color in itself has the
  possibility of mirroring the complexity of the world as much as it has the
  potential for being distinct. "
