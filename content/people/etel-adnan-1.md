short_bio: Poet, essayist, and painter Etel Adnan’s career spans more than six
  decades and encompasses a wide range of media—including painting, drawing,
  tapestry, film, ceramics, and leporello artist books—as it does traditions and
  locations. Adnan was first an author of poetry and prose, often addressing and
  protesting against the turmoil of the Vietnam War and the Lebanese Civil War.
  Informing her writing and later her artwork as well, was the landscape, its
  own history and her emotional and physical response to it. For Adnan, the
  landscape is mingled with memory, especially a sentiment of displacement, as
  she was born and raised in Lebanon, but has lived, studied, and worked in
  France and California throughout her life.  Adnan was born in Beirut and now
  lives and works in Paris.
