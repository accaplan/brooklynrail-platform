short_bio: Barbara Rose is an American art historian and critic who has
  published widely in the field of modern American art. Born in 1938 in
  Washington, DC, Rose studied at the Sorbonne, Smith College, Barnard, and
  finally, Columbia University under Meyer Shapiro. Rose became immersed in the
  New York-based circle of modernist artists and curators in the late 1950s and
  early 60s, and made her substantial contribution to the discourse on
  contemporary art with the insider's perspective this afforded her. Rose taught
  at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence, University of California at Irvine and San
  Diego, and the American University Art in Italy program, and was senior
  curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
