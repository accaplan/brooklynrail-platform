short_bio: "Trans, arab-american punk poet-performer cyborg **Andrea Abi-Karam**
  writes on the art of killing bros, the intricacies of cyborg bodies, and
  trauma and delayed healing. Selected by Bhanu Khapil, Andrea’s debut
  _EXTRATRANSMISSION_ (Kelsey Street Press, 2019) is a poetic critique of the
  U.S. military’s role in the War on Terror. Simone White selected their second
  assemblage, _Villainy_, for publication in September 2021 at Nightboat Books.
  With Kay Gabriel, they co-edited _We Want It All: An Anthology of Radical
  Trans Poetics_ (Nightboat Books, 2020). They are a leo currently obsessed with
  queer terror and convertibles."
