short_bio: "Poet and digital artist **Patrick Hill** is a fourth-year student in
  the BFA Writing program at Pratt Institute. His work and studies have focused
  on the use of hybrid and multimedia forms, including text, memes, and code, to
  investigate the contradictions of American life in the post-internet era. He
  has recently completed a full length manuscript, a hybrid auto-fiction about
  coming of age and finding connection in the late 2010's entitled
  _Doomscrolling_. Patrick lives and works in Brooklyn, N.Y. with his partner. "
