short_bio: "Peter Saul is considered by many to be one of the most singular
  artists of his generation, whose paintings have continued to challenge
  audiences over the course of a career spanning more than six decades. Born in
  San Francisco, California in 1934, he briefly attended Stanford University and
  the California School of Fine Arts before going on to receive his BFA from
  Washington University, St Louis in 1956. If any single theme defines Saulâ€™s
  work as a whole, it is his willingness or more accurately, his eagerness to
  shock audiences. "
