short_bio: "Born in San Francisco in 1934, **Peter Saul** is considered one of
  the fathers of Pop Art. He is known for his distinctly colorful and cartoonish
  paintings which satirize American culture. His use of childlike marks and
  clashing colors are meant to both disturb and engage the viewer. In his over
  fifty year career, Saul has depicted the most pressing issues of society in a
  manner that destroys pretensions, exposes artificiality, and heightens
  awareness. Saul was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
  Fellowship in 1993 and received the Artists' Legacy Foundation Award in 2008
  and the Francis J. Greenburger Award in 2013. He was elected to the American
  Academy of Arts and Letters in 2010. "
