short_bio: New York based artist **Josiah McElheny**’s sculptures, paintings,
  installations, performances, and films engage with the history of ideas across
  wide-ranging fields of study—from literature to architecture, music theory,
  and astronomy—transforming this research into physical form. His works often
  combine glass or mirror with other materials, to emphasize the importance of
  the act of looking “as a subject in and of itself.” A skilled glassblower,
  McElheny frequently incorporates hand-blown and shaped glass within evocative
  assemblages, whose mode of presentation creates a sense of unsettled ideals,
  and a challenge to fixed definitions. The material serves as a productive
  agent, inciting chance encounters between forms and ideas that point toward
  alternative histories and futures.
