short_bio: "’s work and being lies at the complex intersections of the theory
  and practice of land politics and soil health. Her work as a communicator,
  translator, curator, provocateur, and medium is internationally recognized in
  communities of practice ranging from publishing to fine art, environmental
  justice activism to philosophy, growing to podcasting. She lives her work—she
  writes, facilitates, lectures, teaches, consults, makes, and does. She marries
  these two sets of practice under two organizing structures: Spontaneous
  Vegetation and Social Ecologies."
