short_bio: "Visual artist who trained as an architect, **Amanda Williams**
  employs color as an operative means for drawing attention to the complex ways
  race informs how we assign value to the spaces we occupy. Williamsâ€™
  installations, sculptures, paintings, and works on paper seek to inspire new
  ways of looking at the familiar and in the process, raise questions about the
  state of urban space and ownership in America. Her breakthrough series,
  _Color(ed) Theory_, a set of condemned south side of Chicago houses, painted
  in a monochrome palette derived from racially and culturally codified color
  associations, was recently named by the _New York Times_ as one of the
  twenty-five most significant works of postwar architecture in the world. "
