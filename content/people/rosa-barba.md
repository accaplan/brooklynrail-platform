short_bio: "Currently based in Berlin, Germany, **Rosa Barba** (born 1972,
  Agrigento, Italy) is a German-Italian visual artist and filmmaker. Barba is
  known for using the medium of film and its materiality to create cinematic
  film installations, sculptures and publications, which inquire into the
  ambiguous nature of reality, memory, landscape and their role in their mutual
  constitution and representation. Her engagement with analogue film has been
  linked to the work of other contemporary practitioners such as Matthew
  Buckingham, Tacita Dean, Luke Fowler, and Ben Rivers. She has received
  numerous awards and recognitions, most recently, The Calder Prize (New York,
  2020). "
