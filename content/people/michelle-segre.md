short_bio: In her sculptures of plaster, wire, mesh, found detritus, and various
  organic matter, **Michelle Segre** develops a heterogeneous vision, informed
  as much by mega-ancient Neolithic idols as by Joan Mir√≥ and science fiction.
  The effect is fantastical and bizarre, an invitation to negotiate an alternate
  reality. Segre's work hovers at an edge where everything remains fragmentary
  and incomplete, refusing to fulfill expectations. The process is
  improvisational and fluid, resulting in pieces that are both playfully casual
  and intense. Segre has had solo exhibitions at institutions such as Cress
  Gallery (University of Tennessee, Chattanooga), and she has been honored with
  the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
  Foundation Fellowship, and others.
