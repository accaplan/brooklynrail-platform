pronouns: he/him
short_bio: "**Martin Bakero** makes poetry with breath, syllable, phoneme,
  verse, healing and joy: creating a nomenclature between the acoustic image and
  the poetic body. He uses anti-rhetoric invocatory metrics, transmuting the
  distance between the word and the thing, the real and the delusion; exploring
  the frontiers between sense, sound, smell and vision which are diffused in
  various electroacoustic systems. His compositions employ various techniques of
  theurgic cabalistic reading-writing and extended vocal works. In direct
  connection with radio poetry astronomy, he explores what he calls ArTeluric,
  in which he works with sounds from the interior of the earth and other stars
  thanks to infrasonic pickup instruments and spatializes them."
