  material investigations in dialogue with recent histories of displacement and
  disenfranchisement of people of color, resulting in formalist compositions of
  exuberant color, bold geometries, and intricate layerings of material. Recent
  solo exhibitions include_Brown II_, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at
  Harvard University, Cambridge, MA (2021); _The Land Claim at the Parrish Art
  Museum_, Water Mill, NY (2021); _Love Rollercoaster_, Wexner Center for the
  Arts, Columbus, OH (2020); among many others. She was awarded the Joan
