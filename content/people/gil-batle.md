short_bio: Gil Batle was born and raised in San Francisco to Filipino parents,
  was in and out of five different California prisons over 20 years for fraud
  and forgery, and is now living on a small island in the Philippines. Batle’s
  self-taught drawing ability evolved behind bars into sophisticated and
  clandestine tattooing skills that protected him from murderous gang violence
  in prisons such as San Quentin, Chuckawalla, and Jamestown— the “Gladiator
  School.” Where Bloods, Crips, and Aryan Brotherhood gang-bangers in racially
  segregated cell-blocks rule with intimidation and threat, Batle’s facility for
  drawing was considered magic by the murderers, drug dealers, and armed robbers
  whose stories he now recounts in minutely carved detail on fragile ostrich
  eggshells.
