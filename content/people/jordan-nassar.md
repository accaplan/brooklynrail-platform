short_bio: Artist **Jordan Nassar’s** multivalent practice engages the material
  variety of craft to execute ideas centered on heritage and homeland. Through
  hand-embroidery, wood inlay, glass and expansive installations, he examines
  issues of identity, diaspora and cultural participation. Nassar often employs
  “the landscape” as a thread throughout these different mediums, using fields
  of color to define rolling hills and expanses of water.  His work has been
  featured in solo and group exhibitions globally at institutions including the
  Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; Asia Society, New York, NY; and
  many others. Jordan Nassar is the recipient of the 2021 Unbound United States
  Artists Fellowship in craft. His upcoming solo exhibitions at the ICA Boston
  will open August 11, 2022.
