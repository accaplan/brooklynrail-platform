short_bio: Wardell Milan is a visual artist who makes works on paper, painting,
  mixed media, videos, and photographs. Milan combines drawing and photography
  in collages and three-dimensional dioramas. Milan sustains a thoughtful
  inquiry into the nature of beauty and the unconscious, touching on topics such
  as body modification and gender performance. His most recent series, Parisian
  Landscapes, explores the duality between marginalization and freedom of
  expression, imagining places where the marginalized body is able to express
  itself and move about the world freely. Milan studied photography at the
  University of Tennessee and Yale University. Milan lives and works in New
  York.
