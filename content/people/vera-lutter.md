short_bio: "While she has gained international recognition for her uniquely
  produced camera obscura images of industrial and architectural sites around
  the world, **Vera Lutter** continues to feature New York City as a recurring
  subject in her practice. In addition to her work with the camera obscura, she
  has made video work that focuses on how light and sound articulate time’s
  passing. Her work has been published in Art Forum, BOMB, and other
  publications, as well as many books on contemporary art. Lutter has received
  several awards, including a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2002) and the
  John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2001). In early 2017
  Lutter was announced as LACMA’s first artist in residence. "
