short_bio: EJ Hauser’s painting practice is deliberately multifaceted, an
  aggregate of multiple threads and conversations. Discrete bodies of work
  coalesce to form a larger project, with subsets including text-based works,
  figurative painting, abstract painting, and conceptual approaches to color.
  Hauser approaches paintings first by establishing an armature and then
  building up and out from this initial structure. These early forms diverge and
  challenge singular readings of painting, canonical notions of "signature"
  practices, and gender identity as it relates to painting and art-making.
  Hauser’s work has been shown at The Journal Gallery, Regina Rex, NURTUREart,
  James Fuentes, and Never Work Gallery, all in New York City, among others.
