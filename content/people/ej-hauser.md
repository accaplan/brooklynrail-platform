short_bio: EJ Hauser is a painter who lives and works in Brooklyn and is
  represented by Derek Eller Gallery and Philipp Haverkampf Gallery. Her
  paintings are graphic yet open to interpretation, teetering between
  iconography and something familiar but abstract. This imagery shifts between
  omnivorous references both ancient and current, her paintings are mysterious
  talisman, employing buzzing pallets and marks that dance. Stuttering lines
  form a visual code like musical notes, which coalesce with atmospheric layers
  to create ineffable messages. Her work has been shown in numerous group
  exhibitions in New York and in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Frieze, and
  The Brooklyn Rail, among others. EJ is an Adjunct Assistant Professor of
  Visual Arts at Columbia University in the Graduate Department.
