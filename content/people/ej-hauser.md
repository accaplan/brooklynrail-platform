short_bio: EJ Hauser is a painter who lives and works in Brooklyn. Her paintings
  are both graphic and open to interpretation, teetering between iconography and
  something familiar but abstract. This imagery shifts between omnivorous
  references both ancient and current, her paintings are a mysterious talisman,
  employing buzzing pallets and marks that dance. EJâ€™s source library includes
  potent power objects, which are cross-pollinated with formal qualities and
  care found in domestic craftwork, like rugs, fabrics, wallpapers, and mosaics,
  as well as digital visual characteristics, which she interprets through
  drawing and then transliterates onto canvas. Each piece is composed of
  multiple layers of color. The vibrating color connects directly to the energy
  and aliveness of her nature-based subject matter.
