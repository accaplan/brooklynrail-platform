short_bio: "Artist, musician, writer, filmmaker, and activist **Issa Ibrahim**
  is a 25-year artist-in-residence at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center’s Living
  Museum, and now as an artist of Fountain House Gallery. “Knocking down the
  icon” has been a major theme since his teen years, influenced in the late
  1970s by punk rock. Anarchic takes on comic strip themes stay with Issa and
  resonate, lending him the capacity to merge the lowbrow with the erudite, the
  truth behind the fairy tale. Issa is the author of the 2016 memoir _The
  Hospital Always Wins_. He has been featured on German public television, in an
  HBO documentary, and in an Edward R. Murrow and Third Coast award-winning NPR
  audio story. "
