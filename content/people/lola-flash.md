short_bio: "Lola Flash uses photography to challenge stereotypes and offer new
  ways of seeing that transcend and interrogate gender, sexual, and racial
  norms. Flash works primarily in portraiture with a 4x5 film camera, engaging
  those who are often deemed invisible. In 2008, she was a resident at
  Lightwork. Most recently, Flash was awarded an Art Matters grant, which
  allowed her to further two projects, in Brazil and London. Flash has work
  included in important public collections such as the Victoria and Albert
  Museum in London.  Her work is featured in the publication Posing Beauty,
  edited by Deb Willis, currently on exhibit across the US, and she is in the
  current award-winning film “Through A Lens Darkly”. "
