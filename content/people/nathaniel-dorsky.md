short_bio: "Nathaniel Dorsky is an experimental filmmaker and film editor who
  has been making films since 1963. He has resided in San Francisco since 1971.
  “The films of Nathaniel Dorsky blend a beauteous celebration of the sensual
  world with a deep sense of introspection and solitude. They are occasions for
  reflection and meditation, on light, landscape, time, and the motions of
  consciousness. Their luminous photography emphasizes the elemental frisson
  between solidity and luminosity, between spirit and matter, while his uniquely
  developed montage permits a fluid and flowing experience of time. Dorsky’s
  films reveal the mystery behind everyday existence, providing intimations of
  eternity.“ - Steve Polta, San Francisco Cinematheque. "
