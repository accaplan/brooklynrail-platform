short_bio: "Hugh Hayden transforms familiar materials to challenge our
  perceptions of ourselves, others, and the environment. Raised in Texas and
  trained as an architect, his work arises from a deep connection to nature and
  its organic materials. By transforming familiar objects to challenge human
  perception, Hayden investigates how we view ourselves and our surroundings. He
  utilizes wood as his primary medium, frequently loaded with multi-layered
  histories in their origin, including objects as varied as discarded trunks,
  rare indigenous timber, Christmas trees, or souvenir African sculptures.
  Haydenâ€™s work questions the stasis of social dynamics and asks the viewer to
  examine their place within an ever-shifting ecosystem. "
