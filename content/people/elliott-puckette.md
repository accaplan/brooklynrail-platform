short_bio: Elliott Pucketteâ€™s delicate and ethereal paintings are a continual
  exploration of the dynamic possibilities of the line. Evocative of written
  music and ancient script, her linear abstraction is rendered either by etching
  into prepared ground with a razor blade or drawing meticulously with ink on an
  expanse of paper. Puckette received her BFA from Cooper Union in New York in
  1989. Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Whitney
  Museum of American Art, the New York Public Library, the Fogg Museum, and the
  Huntsville Museum of Art. She has been represented by Kasmin since 1993.
  Elliott was born in Lexington, Kentucky and currently lives and works in
  Brooklyn, NY.
