short_bio: "The work of painter and sculptor **Siobhan Liddell** deals with the
  space between knowing and unknowing, the mystery in the everyday, history, and
  the continuum of desire to record and create our unique worlds. Siobhan's work
  has always found a means through subtlety, engaging spaces with a delicate
  awareness, using ambient light and the reflective color of materials that, in
  their faintly glowing hues, hold a quiet power beside her intermittent and
  poetic use of text. Liddellâ€™s work has been shown in renowned institutions
  around the world, including the 1995 Whitney Biennial. She is the recipient of
  the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award and the recipient of the Rome Prize: Vera
  List Fellowship 2011-12."
