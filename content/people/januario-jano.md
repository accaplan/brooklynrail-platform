short_bio: Januario Jano is a multi-disciplinary artist who lives and works
  between London, Luanda, and Lisbon. Reflecting on the ideas of home and self,
  he explores historical and contemporary narratives within the globalization
  context. It is seduced in the parallel between fiction and reality, the
  increased concern about the ecological relationship between humans, nature,
  and non-humans, that creates the intersection to engage with the complex
  themes around space and time. The body is pivotal, and its representation
  occurs within the increasingly globalized and cross-cultural dimension, which
  facilitates his engagement with sculpture, installations, and performance.
