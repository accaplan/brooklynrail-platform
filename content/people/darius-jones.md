short_bio: Critically acclaimed saxophonist and composer **Darius Jones** has
  created a recognizable voice by embracing individuality and innovation in the
  tradition of African-American music. Jones has been awarded the Van Lier
  Fellowship, Jerome Foundation Commission, Jerome Artist-in-Residence at
  Roulette, French-American Jazz Exchange Award, and, in 2019, the Fromm Music
  Foundation commission at Harvard University. Jones has released a string of
  diverse recordings featuring music and images evocative of Black Futurism. His
  work as a new music composer for voice culminated in a major debut performance
  at Carnegie Hall in 2014. Jonesâ€™ music is a confrontation against apathy and
  ego, hoping to inspire authenticity that compels us to be better humans.
