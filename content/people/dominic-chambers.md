short_bio: "The recipient of, among other awards, the Robert Reed Drawing
  Scholarship (Yale University 2018), **Dominic Chambers** creates vibrant
  paintings that engage art historical models, such as color-field painting, and
  contemporary concerns around race, identity, and the necessity for leisure and
  reflection. Interested in how art functions as a mode for understanding or
  renegotiating one’s relationship to the world, Chambers sees painting as an
  intellectual endeavor, as much as an aesthetic one. A writer himself, Chambers
  draws inspiration from W.E.B. Du Bois, particularly _The Souls of Black Folk_,
  and one of its central themes―the veil. References to this metaphorical lens
  through which Black bodies are observed appear throughout his work. Chambers
  currently lives and works in New Haven, CT. "
