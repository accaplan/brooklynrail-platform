short_bio: "Catherine Opie is known for her powerfully dynamic photography that
  examines the ideals and norms surrounding the culturally constructed American
  dream and American identity. She first gained recognition in the 1990s for her
  series of studio portraits titled Being and Having, in which she photographed
  gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals drawn from her circle of friends and
  artists. Opie has traveled extensively across the country exploring the
  diversity of America’s communities and landscapes, documenting quintessential
  American subjects—while also continuing to display America’s subcultures
  through formal portraits. "
