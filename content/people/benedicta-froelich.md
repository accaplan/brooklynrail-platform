  Cagnone, is a novelist, journalist, translator and interpreter. History and
  the English-speaking world and its language have always been her main
  passions, together with the art of storytelling; after starting out as a
  cartoonist and publishing two books for children and young adults, she left
  for Scotland and majored in Scottish history, and then devoted herself to
  historical and biographical novels. Her most recent novels are *Nella sua
  quiete*, 2014 (about T.E. Lawrence) and *L’Indicibile inverno*, 2020 (about
  Captain Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic). She currently lives in
