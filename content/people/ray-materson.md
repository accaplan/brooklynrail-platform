short_bio: "Raymond Materson is a self-taught artist known for miniature
  pictures that he sews from threads of unraveled socks. He came upon this
  approach to making art while serving 7 years in prison. He remembered his
  childhood and how he watched his Grandmother sewing peacefully for hours. His
  initial sewing efforts required colored threads that he got from pulling apart
  his socks. He began by sewing sports patches for himself and other inmates. He
  has continued creating art since his release from prison over 25 years ago.
  Materson’s story was published in 2002 in Sins and Needles: A Story of
  Spiritual Mending. Materson has had numerous gallery shows as well as being
  exhibited in museums and most recently at Christie’s in New York. "
