short_bio: "**Susan Wides**, the Curator and Director of ‘T’ Space, has curated
  over 30 exhibitions as well as their poetry, music performances, exhibition
  texts, and publications since 2010. Wides is a photo-based artist—nature and
  perception are driving forces of her work. She uses the language of the lens
  and its conceptual, psychological, and formal dimensions to create abstract,
  hybrid photographic spaces fused with an ecologically driven representation.
  Over 25 solo exhibitions of Wides’ work include a survey at The Hudson River
  Museum, The Center for Creative Photography, PS122, The Samuel Dorsky Museum,
  and the storied Galerie Urbi et Orbi in Paris. Her work resides in the
  permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, ICP, among many others and is
  widely published."
