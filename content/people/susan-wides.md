short_bio: "**Susan Wides** is the Curator and Director of ‘T’ Space, a
  nonprofit gallery dedicated to the synthesis of art, poetry, music,
  architecture fused with nature in the woodlands of Rhinebeck, NY. She lives
  and works as a camera artist in the Hudson Valley. Nature and perception are
  driving forces of her work. Wides uses the language of the lens and its
  conceptual, psychological, and formal dimensions to create abstract, hybrid
  photographic spaces fused with an ecologically driven representation. Solo
  exhibitions of Wides’ work include a survey at The Hudson River Museum, The
  Center for Creative Photography PS122, The Samuel Dorsky Museum, and the
  storied Galerie Urbi et Orbi in Paris."
