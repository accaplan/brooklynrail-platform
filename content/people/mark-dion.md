short_bio: Artist **Mark Dion**’s work examines the way dominant ideologies and
  public institutions shape our understandings of history, knowledge, and the
  natural world. The job of the artist, he says, is to go against the grain of
  dominant culture, to challenge perception and convention. Appropriating
  archaeological, field ecology and other scientific methods of collecting,
  ordering, and exhibiting objects, Dion creates works that question the
  distinctions between ‘objective’ (‘rational’) scientific methods and
  ‘subjective’ (‘irrational’) influences. Dions holds a BFA and an honorary
  doctorate from the University of Hartford School of Art, Connecticut. He is a
  cofounder and co-director of Mildred's Lane. He was born in New Bedford, MA in
  1961.
