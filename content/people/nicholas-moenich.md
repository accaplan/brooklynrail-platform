last_name: Moenich
short_bio: "Borrowing from art history, mythology, punk rock, and science
  fiction, **Nicholas Moenich**’s work creates eerie psychological spaces. His
  complex and personal formal language is situated between figuration and
  abstraction—creating paintings that simultaneously possess material presence
  and pictorial space full of sinister humor. Moenich holds an MFA from Hunter
  College and a BFA from the Cleveland Institute of Art. He has exhibited at
  Underdonk, D’Agostino & Fiore, and Disturb the Neighbors. "
