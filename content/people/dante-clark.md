pronouns: he/him
short_bio: Bronx- based **Dante Clark** is a writer, musician, and actor. A
  two-time Pushcart nominee, his work has been featured in The Root, Afropunk,
  wildness, Brooklyn Poets’ Poet of the Week, The Slowdown, Hooligan Mag, and
  elsewhere. Clark graduated from Hunter College with a BA in creative writing
  and he has the student loan debt to prove it. He’s performed his poetry at
  venues like the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the Bowery Poetry Club, The Montauk
  Club, and his living room (much to the chagrin of his downstairs neighbors).
  Clark has also received support from organizations including Catapult, Cave
  Canem, and In Surreal Life where he served as a co-fellow for the 2021
  sessions. Along with wanting to free the land, Dante just wants to create in a
  world where all his homies can prosper.
