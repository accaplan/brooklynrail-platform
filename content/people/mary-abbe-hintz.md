short_bio: "Mary Abbe has been writing about art and cultural affairs since
  1977. During her 32 year tenure as art critic and art news reporter at the
  Minneapolis Star Tribune, she wrote stories, profiled Minnesota artists and
  museum staff, reviewed exhibitions, analyzed national cultural politics and
  finance, and penned stories inspired by art-themed travel in Europe. An
  advocate of snappy ledes and jargon-free lingo, she remains confident that, no
  matter how esoteric art may sometimes appear, it will interest anyone if the
  writing about it is engaging and informative. "
