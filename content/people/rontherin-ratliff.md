short_bio: Rontherin Ratliff is a mixed media sculptor whose work focuses on
  ideas of balance and the human condition. He blends functionality, aesthetic,
  context, and associations to address subjects of loneliness, loss,
  homesickness, memory, and the burdens we carry. Ratliff examines the metaphor
  of the body as a house where the mind dwells. Feeling at home or in harmony
  within including home as one's origin or domestic place. The work questions
  the sociocultural constructed concepts of self. With it, he contemplates
  reservations regarding home as a safe-haven where one experiences positive
  qualities such as security and comfort. Using architectural materials and
  domestic objects, his work explores the notion of internal versus external
  balance.
