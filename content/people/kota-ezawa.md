short_bio: "Ezawa was born in Germany, where he began his undergraduate studies
  at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf with Nam Jun Paik and Nan Hoover before
  relocating to the Bay Area. Kota Ezawa’s work explores the appropriation and
  mediation of current events and images, referencing sources from the news, art
  history, and popular culture. Since the debut of his 2002 video animation The
  Simpson Verdict, Ezawa has been well-known for creating light-boxes, videos,
  and works on paper that distill found images into his signature pared-down,
  flattened style. By reducing complex visual information to its most essential,
  two-dimensional elements, he explores the photographic record’s validity as a
  mediator of actual events and experiences. "
