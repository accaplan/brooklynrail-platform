short_bio: David Opdyke is an artist known for his trenchant political send-ups
  of American culture. Opdykeâ€™s political awakening in the early 2000s led to a
  body of work that confronts the horrors of contemporary America. His hyperreal
  topographical models of suburbs comment on mall culture and suburban sprawl,
  while his sculptures of ruined monuments mock imperialistic hubris. His work
  is held in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, MoMA, and the Washington
  Convention Center.
