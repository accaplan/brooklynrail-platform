short_bio: Contemporary American artist **Deborah Kass** has a practice spanning
  across media and disciplines, notable for her pointed feminist critique.
  Through her use of appropriation, she often mimics the work and styles of male
  artists to comment on and rewrite the patriarchal narrative of art history.
  Born in San Antonio, TX in 1952, she went on to receive her BFA from Carnegie
  Mellon University and study at both the Whitney Independent Study Program and
  the Art Students League in New York before rising to art world fame. Her
  honors include a mid-career retrospective at The Andy Warhol Museum in
  Pittsburgh, inclusion in multiple Venice Biennales, and the position of senior
  critic at the Yale University painting program.
