short_bio: Artist **Arcmanoro Niles** makes vivid, brightly-hued paintings that
  expand our understanding of traditional genre painting and portraiture. His
  paintings, though intensely personal and autobiographical, engage in universal
  subjects of domestic and family life while also making reference to numerous
  art historical predecessors, including Italian and Dutch baroque, history
  painting, Color Field painting, and ancient Egyptian sculpture. Niles is
  particularly inspired by the paintings that 16th century Italian painter
  Caravaggio created of daily life through representations of his family and
  friends. In depicting not only people close to him but the places and times
  they inhabit, Niles creates his own record of contemporary life.
