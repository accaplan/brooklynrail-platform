short_bio: "Artist and composer Samita Sinha creates multidisciplinary
  performance works that investigate origins of voice: the quantum entanglement
  of listening and sounding, how voice emerges from the body and consciousness,
  and how voice can be claimed and rescued from voicelessness. She synthesizes
  Indian vocal traditions (Hindustani classical and Bengali Baul folk) and
  embodied energetic practices to create a decolonized, bodily, multivalent
  language of vibration and transformation. "
