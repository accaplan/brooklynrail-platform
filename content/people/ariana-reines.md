  **Ariana Reines** has published nine books of poetry, most recently _A Sand
  Book_ (2019). Her poems have been anthologized in _Corrected Slogans_ (2013)
  and other publications. At once personal, romantic, slippery, and extreme,
  Reinesâ€™s poetry investigates and overturns lyric conventions. Reines was
  awarded the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award in 2020. She has taught at Columbia
  University and the European Graduate School, where she studied literature,
  performance, and philosophy. In 2009 she was the Roberta C. Holloway Lecturer
  in Poetry at the University of California-Berkeley, the youngest poet to ever
  hold that position. She has also served as a translator on United Nations
  missions to Haiti.
