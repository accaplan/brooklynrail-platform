short_bio: "Working primarily in film, video, and performance, **Andrew
  Lampert** pursues the alchemy between artist, art, and audience in a public
  space, especially that of cinema. A trained film archivist, Lampert revels in
  cinema as a performative environment, and reclaims this space from a mass
  media culture to emphasize its potential for immediacy and accident. He
  regularly exhibits in national and international contexts, and has taught at
  CUNY City College, Purchase College, The New School, and Cooper Union. He
  frequently writes on art and cinema, is the coauthor of _Art in America_'s
  \"Hard Truths\" Column, and has edited multiple catalogues and volumes, most
  recently _Tony Conrad: Writings_ (Primary Information, 2019). "
