short_bio: For over fifty years, **Lois Dodd** (American, b. 1927) has painted
  her immediate everyday surroundings at the places she has chosen to live and
  work—the Lower East Side, rural Mid-Coast Maine, and the Delaware Water Gap.
  Dodd’s small, intimately-scaled paintings are almost always completed in one
  plein-air sitting. Lois Dodd studied at the Cooper Union in the late 1940s,
  and in 1952 she was one of the five founding members of the legendary Tanager
  Gallery. Dodd is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters
  and the National Academy. In 1992 she retired from teaching at Brooklyn
  College. Since 1954 her work has been the subject of over fifty one-person
  exhibitions.
