short_bio: Living and working between Rotterdam and New York, **Ellen
  Gallagher** builds intricate, multi-layered works that pivot between the
  natural world, mythology, and history. Over a highly multifaceted career,
  Gallagher’s work has been united by what she calls a ‘jitter,’ an intellectual
  approach in which aesthetic possibilities are shook loose from seismic cracks
  beneath the surface of cultural entities normally thought to be unshakable and
  impermeable. Her arresting compositions are a process of recovery and
  reconstitution through the accumulation and erasure of media, which results in
  palimpsestic and topographic surfaces that are often carved, inlaid, mounted,
  printed, blotted, and inscribed.
