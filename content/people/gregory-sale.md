short_bio: As a socially-engaged artist, Gregory Sale brings together often
  opposed constituencies of the criminal justice system. His aim is to soften
  and collapse boundaries, thereby encouraging reciprocal dialogue and mutual
  learning. A somewhat quieter but no less political component of his work
  flirts with the fluid parameters of public and private love.
