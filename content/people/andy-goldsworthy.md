short_bio: "Andy Goldsworthy was born in Cheshire, England, in 1956, and is now
  based in Scotland. Goldsworthy has become one of the most prominent and iconic
  contemporary sculptors. In photographs, sculptures, installations, and films,
  Goldsworthy documents his explorations of the effects of time, the
  relationship between humans and their natural surroundings, and the beauty in
  loss and regeneration. Goldsworthyâ€™s permanent projects and ephemeral works
  contrast in their scale, tension, and lifetime, but are unified through their
  responses to the environment and his constant investigation into understanding
  the landscape he is in. "
