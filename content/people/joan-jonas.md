short_bio: Immersed in 1960s downtown New York art scene, Joan Jonas studied
  with the choreographer Trisha Brown for two years and was influenced by the
  work of John Cage and Claes Oldenburg. Adopting the idea of art-as-process,
  she turned from painting and sculpture to performance art. In the early 70s,
  her work became increasingly symbolic, gamelike, and ritualistic. By the 80s,
  she began to create complex, nonlinear narratives premised on literary and
  historical texts, including science-fiction, medieval Icelandic sagas, and,
  more recently, the writings and biography of the art historian Aby Warburg.
  Her most recent work explores the relationship between new digital media and
  performance in multichannel video installations.
