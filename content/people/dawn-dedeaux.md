short_bio: "Pioneering New Orleans–based multimedia artist **Dawn DeDeaux**
  (American, b. 1952) has long worked between worlds. Since the 1970s, her art
  has addressed an ever-widening series of gulfs: between people, between
  cultures and communities, and ultimately between humans and the Earth itself.
  Living and working in Louisiana—one of the fastest disappearing landmasses in
  the world—DeDeaux has been grappling with urgent questions about Earth and
  humanity’s survival for the last fifty years. As we face a world increasingly
  imperiled by rising waters, roiling temperatures, unchecked pandemics, and
  escalating social strife, the future DeDeaux’s work has long foreseen is now.
