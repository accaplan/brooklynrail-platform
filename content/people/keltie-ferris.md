first_name: Keltie
last_name: Ferris
short_bio: Known for his mostly large-scale canvases covered with layers of
  spray paint and hand-painted geometric fields, **Keltie Ferris**’ pixilated
  backgrounds and atmospheric foregrounds create perceptual depth that allows
  for multidimensional readings of his work. Characterized by a continuously
  expanding investigation into painting, his practice considers a multiplanar
  site for constructed light and shifting space. In his ongoing series of body
  prints, Ferris uses his own body like a brush, covering it with natural oils
  and pigments and pressing it against a canvas, to literalize the relationship
  of an artists’ identity to the work that he or she produces. Keltie Ferris was
  born in Kentucky in 1977 and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.
