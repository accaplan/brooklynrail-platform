short_bio: "Artist **Bill Jensen** has lived and worked in New York since the
  early 1970s. He came into prominence with “the return to painting” of the late
  70’s and early 80’s. Intuitive and visceral, Jensen’s abstractions have long
  been admired for their unconventional compositions and profound sense of
  color. Saturated, densely worked surfaces, seemingly primordial in origin,
  transcend any sense of the struggle that Jensen attributes to his painting
  process. Defined by an amorphous, ever-changing search for resolution,
  Jensen’s results are ultimately determined by the act of painting itself.
  Jensen's work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
  Phillips Collection, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among many others. "
