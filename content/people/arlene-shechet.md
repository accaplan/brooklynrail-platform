short_bio: Arlene Shechet employs an experimental approach to ceramic sculpture
  by testing the limits of gravity, color, and texture and pushing the boundary
  of classic techniques, sometimes fusing her kiln-fired creations with complex
  plinths formed of wood, steel, and concrete. By incorporating casts of
  firebricks and porcelain slip molds into her sculptures, she reflects on and
  investigates the tradition of decorative arts. Variously sensual, humorous,
  and elegant, her clay-based vessels evoke the tension between control and
  chaos, beauty and ugliness, perfection and imperfection. Shechet focuses on
  ensuring that the display, sight lines, and relationships of the objects in
  her exhibitions change with every view while maintaining formal equilibrium.
