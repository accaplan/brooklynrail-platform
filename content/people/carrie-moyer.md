short_bio: "Artist **Carrie Moyer** explores and extends the legacy of American
  Abstraction while paying homage to many of its seminal female figures,
  including Georgia O’Keeffe, Helen Frankenthaler, and Elizabeth Murray. Rife
  with visual precedents, Moyer’s compositions reference Color Field, Pop Art
  and 1970s Feminist art, while proposing a new approach to fusing history,
  research, and experimentation in painting. Moyer’s work, influenced by a
  background in design and queer activism, intricately weaves together concept,
  research, and lived experience with a range of stylistic and physical
  references. Her work was recently featured in _Queer Abstraction_ at Des
  Moines Art Center, IA (2019) and _Carrie Moyer and Sheila Pepe: Tabernacles
  for Trying Times_ at the Portland Museum of Art, ME (2020)."
