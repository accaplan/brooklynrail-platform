short_bio: "Exploring the temporality of embodiment, **Avery Nelson** paints in
  bright, metallic palettes, and their work combines figurative, abstract, and
  symbolic visual language, examining the resulting contradictions,
  fragmentation, and tension of juxtaposing divergent forms of representation.
  Nelson received an MFA from Columbia University, a BA from Barnard College,
  and was a participant in the Norfolk Program at Yale University. Nelsonâ€™s work
  has been shown at Rubber Factory (NYC), The Ice House (Garrison), and The
  Lighthouse Works Gallery (Fishers Island), among others. "
