short_bio: "Poet, art critic, and curator John Yau has published over 50 books
  of poetry, fiction, and art criticism. Born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1950 to
  Chinese emigrants, Yau attended Bard College and earned an MFA from Brooklyn
  College in 1978. His first book of poetry, Crossing Canal Street, was
  published in 1976. Since then, he has won acclaim for his poetry’s
  attentiveness to visual culture and linguistic surface. In poems that
  frequently pun, trope, and play with the English language, Yau offers
  complicated, sometimes competing versions of the legacy of his dual
  heritage—as Chinese, American, poet, and artist. "
