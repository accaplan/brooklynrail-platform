short_bio: An American poet and poetry activist, **Bob Holman** is equal parts
  spoken word performer, professor, impresario, activist, proprietor of the
  Bowery Poetry Club, filmmaker and host of _Language Matters_ (2015 Documentary
  of the Year, Berkeley Film Festival), and beyond. From slam to hip-hop, from
  performance to spoken word, he's been a central figure in redefining poetry as
  it exists on, off, and beyond the page. Author of 17 poetry collections, he
  was described by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in _The New Yorker_ as “the postmodern
  promoter who has done more to bring poetry to cafes and bars than anyone since
  Ferlinghetti.” Bob is a contributor of the _Brooklyn Rail_. His two recent
  books, _The UnSpoken_ and _Life Poem_ (both YBK/Bowery Books, 2019), were
  written fifty years apart.
