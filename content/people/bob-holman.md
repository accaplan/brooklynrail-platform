short_bio: An American poet and poetry activist, **Bob Holman** is most closely
  identified with the oral tradition, spoken word, and slam poetry. As a
  promoter of poetry in many media, Holman has spent the last four decades
  working variously as an author, editor, publisher, performer, emcee of live
  events, director of theatrical productions, producer of films and television
  programs, record label executive, university professor, and archivist. He was
  described by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in *The New Yorker* as “the postmodern
  promoter who has done more to bring poetry to cafes and bars than anyone since
  Ferlinghetti.” Bob is a contributor of the *Brooklyn Rail.* His two new books,
  *The UnSpoken* and *Life Poem* (both YBK 2019), were written fifty years
  apart.
