  twenty-first century, his practice both critiques and participates in consumer
  culture. His survey _KAWS: WHAT PARTY_ at the Brooklyn Museum (February
  26â€“September 5, 2021) features more than one hundred broad-ranging works, such
  as rarely seen graffiti drawings and notebooks, paintings and sculptures,
