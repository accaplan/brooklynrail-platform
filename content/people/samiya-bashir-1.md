short_bio: Described as a “dynamic, shape-shifting machine of perpetual motion,”
  **Samiya Bashir** is a poet, writer, librettist, performer, and multi-media
  poetry maker whose work, both solo and collaborative, has been widely
  published, performed, installed, printed, screened, experienced, and Oxford
  comma’d from Berlin to Düsseldorf, Amsterdam to Accra, Florence to Rome and
  across the United States. Sometimes she makes poems of dirt. Sometimes zeros
  and ones. Sometimes light. In 2002 she was a co-founder of Fire & Ink, an
  advocacy organization and writer’s festival for LGBT writers of African
  descent with whom she worked through 2015. Bashir is the author of three
  poetry collections, most recently _Field Theories_, winner of the 2018 Oregon
  Book Award’s Stafford/Hall Award for Poetry.
