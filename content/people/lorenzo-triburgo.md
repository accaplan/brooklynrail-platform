short_bio: Artist **Lorenzo Triburgo**â€™s ambiguous photographs prompt questions
  on the signification of the body. The bright pink bubble gum floating in white
  space at first appears to be of-the-flesh, perhaps an anatomical study. The
  questionable corporeality of the objects renders trans*queer embodiment as an
  unknowable, unfixed entity, reflecting a state of transformation.
