short_bio: "Alanah Odoms is a civil rights leader, mother, and a professional
  and spiritual support to countless activists across Louisiana and beyond. As
  the first Black woman to lead the ACLU of Louisiana in its 65 year history,
  she has answered the call to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights by
  challenging systemic racial and gender injustice – vestiges of slavery
  displayed most prominently in Louisiana’s epidemic of mass incarceration,
  immigrant detention and deportation, and racist policing across the state. "
