short_bio: Internationally recognized as the foremost contemporary African
  American Color Field painter. Gilliam is most widely known for the large color
  stained canvases he draped and suspended from walls and ceilings during the
  late 1960s and early 1970s. Since that time Gilliam's style has undergone a
  number of phases, and he continues to explore new avenues of artistic
  expression. Gilliam's most recent works are textured paintings that
  incorporate or are juxtaposed with metal forms. Gilliam has received two
  National Endowment for the Arts awards, fellowships from the Washington
  Gallery of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Foundation, and an Honorary Doctorate
  of Humane Letters from his alma mater, the University of Louisville.
