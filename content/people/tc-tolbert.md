short_bio: "Hey y’all! My name is TC Tolbert (he/him/hey grrrl!). Instead of a
  bio, here are a few things I’d prefer to share: I like walking up a mountain
  more than walking down; on the Enneagram I'm a 1; I'm a Capricorn; learning is
  infinitely more interesting to me than knowing (scarier, too); with my partner
  I am wildly blessed to care for two pit bulls; I am white and was born and
  raised a girl in Hixson, TN as a speaking-in-tongues Pentecostal and I
  eventually came out as queer, feminist, anti-racist, and trans-masc; I now
  live in Tucson, which occupies the traditional territories of the Tohono
  O’odham and Pascua Yaqui peoples; I never cease to experience simultaneous
  grief and deep love any time I pay attention to the world. I'm wild with
  gratitude for the space and time to be with all of you."
