short_bio: Multidisciplinary artist **Scott Treleaven** was a noted figure in
  90s underground cinema and queer zine circles. The tenets of these practices
  continue to inform his work, with collage functioning as a theoretical
  fulcrum. In Treleaven’s paintings and photographs the ‘cut-up’ invokes unruly
  entropic forces; out of the fractures emerge meditations on perception, queer
  sublimity, utopianism, and the relocation of abstraction as a site of
  transcendental. Exhibitions include Cooper Cole, Toronto (2020, 2018, 2017)
  and FRONT International Triennial, Cleveland (2018); among many others.
  Treleaven’s publications have been included in historical overviews such as
  _The Magazine – Documents of Contemporary Art Series_ (MIT Press 2015).
  Treleaven lives and works in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
