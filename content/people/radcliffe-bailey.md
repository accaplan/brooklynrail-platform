short_bio: "Painter, sculptor, and mixed media artist **Radcliffe Bailey** (b.
  1968, Bridgetown, NJ; lives and works in Atlanta, GA) utilizes the layering of
  imagery, culturally resonant materials and text to explore themes of ancestry,
  race, migration and collective memory. His work often incorporates found
  materials and objects from his past into textured compositions, including
  traditional African sculpture, tintypes of his family members, ships, train
  tracks and Georgia red clay. The cultural significance and rhythmic properties
  of music are also important influences that can be seen throughout his oeuvre.
  Often quilt-like in aesthetic, his practice creates links between diasporic
  histories and potential futures, investigating the evolution or stagnation of
  notions of identity. "
