short_bio: "Artist **Haroon Mirza** was born in 1977 in London where he lives
  and works. He has won international acclaim for installations that test the
  interplay and friction between sound and light waves and electric current. He
  devises kinetic sculptures, performances, and immersive installations and
  describes his role as a composer—manipulating electricity, a live, invisible
  and volatile phenomenon—to make it dance to a different tune and calling on
  instruments as varied as household electronics, vinyl and turntables, LEDs,
  furniture, video footage, and existing artworks to behave differently. He has
  been was awarded the Silver Lion of the Venice Biennale, the Zurich Art Prize,
  the Nam June Paik Art Center Prize, the Calder Art Prize, the COLLIDE
  International Award, among others. "
