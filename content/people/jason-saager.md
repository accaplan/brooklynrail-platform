short_bio: "Exploring landscape as a site littered with scientific falsehoods,
  nonsense, and roads leading to nowhere, **Jason Saager** is a painter whose
  fantastical approach investigates the genre of landscape painting while
  incorporating contemporary ideas that challenge traditional understandings of
  the relationship between humans and nature. He earned an MFA from Hunter
  College and a BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His work has
  been exhibited at Washington Project for the Arts, Life on Mars Gallery, and
  Paul the Apostle Church in New York. Saager has been an Artist in Residence at
  Pioneer Works, as well as the International School of Painting, Drawing, and
  Sculpture in Montecastello di Vibio, Italy. "
