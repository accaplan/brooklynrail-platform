short_bio: "Artist **Nitza Tufiño** was born in Mexico City, and upon receiving
  her BFA in 1970 she decided to settle in Manhattan. In 1973 she created her
  first public mural for the façade of then community-based El Museo del Barrio.
  In the early 1980s she returned to school and obtained an M.S. in Urban
  Affairs from Hunter College with the support of a fellowship from the U.S.
  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Tufiño’s commitment to
  public art led her to be recognized as El Taller Boricua’s first female artist
  in 1970, and has been involved with El Taller since that time. Nitza is also a
  proud member of “El Consejo Grafico”, a national coalition of Latino
  printmaking workshops and individual printmakers. "
