short_bio: Since the early 2000s, Gedi Sibony has used the discarded byproducts
  of industrial production as the basis for exploring the interplay between
  viewer, objects, and space. Sibony's work emphasizes the experience of
  encountering objects in carefully choreographed space. Sibony was born in New
  York City where his father, an immigrant from North Africa, worked as a
  contractor renovating apartments. Witnessing this process as a child, Sibony
  gained an appreciation for the elemental way in which objects and space
  interrelate to shape our environment. Sibony's practice encompasses sculpture,
  installation, drawing and painting â€“ often occupying the space between
  mediums, and between the readymade and the composed.
