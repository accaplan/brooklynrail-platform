short_bio: "Artist **Linda Matalon**'s drawings and sculpture have been featured
  in exhibitions including The Drawing Center, The New Museum in New York and
  Centre Pompidou. Art in America described Matalon’s post-minimalist work as an
  “unflagging effort, by turns dogged, tender, angry and amused, to wrestle pure
  vision into tangible form.” Her art has been in international shows including
  “Risk” at Turner Contemporary, UK “The Circle Walked Casually” at Museo de
  Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires, Deutsche Kunsthalle Berlin, “Linda Matalon,
  Agnes Martin, Joyce Hinterding” at National Art School, Australia, the 11th
  Biennale de Lyon, and the 7th Mercosul Biennial, Brazil. Matalon has received
  grants from the New York Foundation for the Arts and Art Matters. She is
  represented by Kadel Willborn, Düsseldorf. "
