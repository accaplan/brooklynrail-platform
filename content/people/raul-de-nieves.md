short_bio: Multimedia artist, performer, and musician **Raúl de Nieves** has a
  wide-ranging practice, investigating notions of beauty and transformation. De
  Nieves’s visual symbolism draws on classical Catholic and Mexican vernacular
  motifs to create his own unique mythology that challenges and explores themes
  of sexuality, the human body, and individual and public histories. Having
  learned traditional Latin American sewing and beadwork at school and alongside
  family, his work pays tribute to and invents upon traditional forms. De Nieves
  has had solo exhibitions at ICA, Boston, MOCA, Miami, and numerous other
  institutions. He has performed at Documenta 14 and MoMA PS1, among many other
  venues. De Nieves was born in Michoacan, Mexico, and currently lives and works
  in Brooklyn, NY.
