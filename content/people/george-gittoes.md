short_bio: "Described simultaneously as a figurative painter, a modernist, a
  postmodernist, a social realist, a pop artist and an expressionist, **George
  Gittoes** is an eyewitness in the world's contact zones. Visiting the
  battle-and killing-fields of Rwanda, Iraq, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Bosnia
  and Afghanistan, he captures the atrocities and attacks on basic human rights,
  producing poignant, rare images of the aftermath of terror, shock and death on
  the edge of human experience. Also an internationally acclaimed filmmaker,
  several feature films covering the war on terror have been released by Gittoes
  since 2004. Gittoes has received multiple awards and recognitions, including
  an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of NSW (2008) and the Blake
  Prize for Religious Art (1995). "
