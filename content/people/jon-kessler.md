short_bio: "Artist **Jon Kessler** was born in Yonkers in 1957. He earned a
  B.F.A. from SUNY Purchase. Known for his kinetic sculptures and multi-media
  installations, his work critiques the current obsession with images and
  surveillance and explores themes of anxiety and climate crisis via found
  objects combined with motorized machines. Structurally complex and narratively
  engaging, Jon Kesslerâ€™s multimedia sculptures often deliver an emotional punch
  beyond their humble means. He is currently a professor at the School of the
  Arts at Columbia University. Kessler's work is included in many significant
  collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American
  Art, the Walker Art Center, the Israel Museum and the Museum of Contemporary
  Art in Los Angeles.  "
