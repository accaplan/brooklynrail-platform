short_bio: Los Angeles-based artist **Elliott Hundley** is known for expanding
  the traditional notions of collage and assemblage in a multidisciplinary
  practice of painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography that synthesizes
  ancient epics, futuristic narratives, and contemporary realities. Hundley
  leverages an abiding knowledge of classical mythology and literature to weave
  a fabric of allusions, informing projects such as his 2011 solo exhibition at
  the Wexner Center for the Arts, and took on the Ancient Greek tragedy _The
  Bacchae_ by Euripides as its subject matter. In 2019, Hundley inaugurated the
  exhibition series _Open House_ at MOCA, Los Angeles, exploring how the visual
  and material logic of collage has informed artists in MOCAâ€™s collection, as
  well as his own practice.
