short_bio: Born in 1985 in Beijing, **Liu Shiyuan** is now based in Beijing and
  Copenhagen. The scope of her art practice comprises of photography, video,
  stage performance and spatial installations. She exposes a visual language
  that's unaffected by regional boundaries. Liu's early works emphasized a
  questioning of boundaries. She makes exaggerated use of symbolic, unassuming
  objects to satirize the contradictions between the way businesses are operated
  and our (i.e. human) beliefs. Recently, her art has become geared towards
  comical misreading of the relations between different historical civilizations
  and nature's status quo. Recent solo exhibitions include _For Jord,_ Tanya
  Bonakdar Gallery, LA (2020) and _In Other Words, Please Be True,_ WHITE SPACE
  BEIJING, Beijing (2019) among many others.
