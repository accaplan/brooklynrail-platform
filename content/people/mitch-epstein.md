short_bio: Artist **Mitch Epstein** is a photographer who helped pioneer
  fine-art color photography in the 1970s. Published by Steidl Verlag, _Property
  Rights_ is a collection of photographs and short texts examining the American
  governmentâ€™s ongoing legacy of property confiscation, and how communities
  gather to resist. Epstein began this series in 2017 at Standing Rock, where
  thousands protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Sioux
  land. Over four years, he charted other contested lands from Pennsylvania and
  Hawaii to the Mexican border, as well as land loss through wildfires and
  flooding due to egregious environmental negligence. In 2020, Mitch Epstein was
  inducted as an Academician to the National Academy of Design.
