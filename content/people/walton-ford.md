short_bio: Artist **Walton Ford** graduated from the Rhode Island School of
  Design to become a filmmaker, but later adapted his talents as a storyteller
  to his unique style of large-scale watercolor. Blending depictions of natural
  history with political commentary, Ford's paintings satirize the history of
  colonialism and the continuing impact of slavery and other forms of political
  oppression on today's social and environmental landscape. Ford is the
  recipient of several national awards and honors including a fellowship from
  the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for
  the Arts. Ford's work has been featured at Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the
  Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, and other institutions. Ford and his
  family reside in upstate New York.
