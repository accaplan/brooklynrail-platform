short_bio: "Artist **Walton Ford**’s expansive watercolor paintings appropriate
  the informative detail and narrative scope of traditional natural history art
  only to subvert its conventions. Representing touchpoints of cultural and
  natural history, he alludes to colonialism, extinction, and the ecological
  consequences of the Anthropocene epoch, tempering his works’ violence,
  tragedy, and eulogies for the natural world with moments of wit and satire.
  Ford is the recipient of several national awards and honors including a
  fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National
  Endowment for the Arts. Ford’s work has been featured at Bowdoin College
  Museum of Art, the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, and other
  institutions. "
