short_bio: Through painting and drawing, **Ryan Martin** creates surreal,
  dream-like compositions, influenced by his roots, growing up in Southern
  California during the 80’s & 90’s. Martin’s portraits are loosely haloed by
  floral and fauna; these haloes embody his Native American (Mexican/Yaqui)
  roots, taking the place of warbonnets which are attributed to males and
  masculinity during Native American rituals. The ring of botanical designs also
  reference Martin’s Russian heritage, through a reinterpretation of kokoshniks,
  which are attributed to the feminine. At times the medium is scattered and
  abstracted within the compositions. Martin’s artworks also include
  photography, video and investigations of texture through installation work. He
  has exhibited widely across the US, including five solo shows.
