short_bio: Eliasson grew up in Iceland and Denmark and studied at the Royal
  Danish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1995, he moved to Berlin and founded Studio
  Olafur Eliasson. Eliasson lives and works in Copenhagen and Berlin. His art is
  driven by his interests in perception, movement, embodied experience, and
  feelings of self. He strives to make the concerns of art relevant to society
  at large. Art, for him, is a crucial means for turning thinking into doing in
  the world. Eliassonâ€™s works span sculpture, painting, photography, film, and
  installation. Not limited to the confines of the museum and gallery, his
  practice engages the broader public sphere through architectural projects,
  interventions in civic space, arts education, policy-making, and issues of
  sustainability and climate change.
