short_bio: "Ursula Von Rydingsvard has lived and worked in New York City for
  over 40 years. Over a remarkable four-decade-long career, Ursula has become
  one of the most influential sculptors working today. She is known for creating
  large-scale, often monumental sculpture from cedar beams, which she
  painstakingly cuts, assembles, and laminates before finally rubbing a graphite
  patina into the work’s textured, faceted surfaces. Her signature abstract
  shapes refer to things in the real world — vessels, bowls, tools, and other
  objects — each revealing the mark of the human hand while also summoning
  natural forms and forces. In recent years, von Rydingsvard has explored other
  mediums in depth, such as bronze, paper, and resin, continuing to expand upon
  her unique artistic vocabulary. "
