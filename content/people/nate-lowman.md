short_bio: "New Yorkâ€“based artist **Nate Lowman** (b. 1979) deftly mines
  mass-produced images culled from art history, the news, and popular media,
  transforming visual signifiers from these distinct sources into a diverse body
  of paintings, sculptures, collages, prints, and installations. Since the early
  2000s, Lowman has continually pushed the boundaries of language and object
  making with works that are at turns political, humorous, and poetic. The
  artist's work was the subject of a solo exhibition at Astrup Fearnley Museet,
  Oslo, in 2018. Other recent solo presentations at public institutions include
  those at the Aspen Art Museum, Colorado (2017); FRAC Champagne-Ardenne, Reims,
  France (2016); Dallas Contemporary, Texas (2015), among others. "
