short_bio: Los Angeles-based artist **Richard Hawkins**'s multimedia practice
  often reads simultaneously as vividly personal and promiscuously referential.
  Working in collage, painting, and sculpture, several of Hawkins’ series emerge
  from a process of studying, internalizing, and regenerating the ideas of
  historical artists and thinkers, inflected by the specificity of Hawkins’ own
  visual lexicon and biography. Recent solo exhibitions include Greene Naftali,
  New York (2019, 2018, 2016); Tate, Liverpool (2014); Le Consortium, Dijon,
  France (2013); and the Art Institute of Chicago, which traveled to the Hammer
  Museum, Los Angeles (2010). He has been awarded the Arts Matter Fellowship,
  the US/Japan Creative Artist Fellowship, the Otis College of Design Faculty
  Development Grant, among others.
