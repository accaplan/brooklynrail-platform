short_bio: Informed by the dynamic between personal and cultural myths, Perach
  explores how our private narratives are deeply rooted in ancient storytelling
  and conversely how folklore has the ability to tell us intimate, confidential
  stories about ourselves. Perach synthesizes female mythic characters and
  retells their stories while placing them in the current climate. By doing so
  she creates an experience of eeriness, evoking a sense of both familiarity and
  distress. She is interested in exploring how elements associated with the
  domestic sphere operate as an extension of the self and reflect on one's
  heritage and gender role. Her performances reverse this dynamic and exhibit
  the private domestic carpet as an external masquerade both exposing and hiding
  fragments of the self.
