short_bio: Working at the forefront of genderqueer visual politics for more than
  four decades, photographer **Lola Flash’s** work challenges stereotypes and
  gender, sexual, and racial preconceptions. An active member of ACT UP during
  the time of the AIDS epidemic in New York City, Flash was notably featured in
  the 1989 “Kissing Doesn’t Kill” poster. Their art and activism are profoundly
  connected, fueling a life-long commitment to visibility and preserving the
  legacy of LGBTQIA+ and communities of color worldwide. Flash has work in
  important collections such as MoMA, the Whitney, and The Museum of the African
  American of History and Culture. They are currently a proud member of the
  Kamoinge Collective, and on the Board of Queer Art.
