short_bio: "Sanford Biggers lives and works in New York City. His work is an
  interplay of narrative, perspective and history that speaks to current social,
  political and economic happenings while also examining the contexts that bore
  them. Working with antique quilts that echo rumors of their use as signposts
  on the Underground Railroad, he engages these legends and contributes to this
  narrative by drawing and painting directly onto them. Drawing on and playing
  with the tradition of working in marble, Biggers creates hybridized forms that
  transpose, combine and juxtapose classical and historical subjects to create
  alternative meanings and produce “future ethnographies”. As creative director
  and keyboardist, he fronts Moon Medicin, a multimedia concept band. "
