short_bio: "New York based artist **Sanford Biggers** makes work that is an
  interplay of narrative, perspective, and history that speaks to current
  social, political, and economic happenings while also examining the contexts
  that bore them. His diverse practice positions him as a collaborator with the
  past through explorations of often overlooked cultural and political
  narratives from American history. His recent series _Chimeras_ creates
  hybridized forms that transpose, combine, and juxtapose classical and
  historical subjects to create alternative meanings and produce what he calls
  “future ethnographies.” As creative director and keyboardist, he fronts Moon
  Medicin, a multimedia concept band that straddles visual art and music
  performances. "
