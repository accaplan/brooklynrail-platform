short_bio: Xaviera Simmonsâ€™s body of work spans photography, performance, video,
  sound, sculpture and installation. She defines her studio practice, which is
  rooted in an ongoing investigation of experience, memory, abstraction, present
  and future histories-specifically shifting notions surrounding landscape-as
  cyclical rather than linear. In other words, Simmons is committed equally to
  the examination of different artistic modes and processes; for example, she
  may dedicate part of a year to photography, another part to performance, and
  other parts to installation, video, and sound works-keeping her practice in
  constant and consistent rotation, shift, and engagement.
