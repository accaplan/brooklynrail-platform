short_bio: "After studying painting at Yale University, _Sheila Hicks_ began
  weaving and producing fabrics in Central and South America in the early 1960s.
  Attracted to her hand-woven aesthetic, Knoll International collaborated with
  Hicks in 1966 to produce Inca. The woven upholstery design proved highly
  successful worldwide and has been revived many times since its original
  introduction. Choosing to remain on the periphery of the mainstream art world,
  Hicks has consistently blurred the lines between art, craft and design. Her
  work has been shown across the globe and is in the permanent collections of
  The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and others. "
