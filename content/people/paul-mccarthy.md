short_bio: "Widely considered to be one of the most influential and
  groundbreaking contemporary American artists, **Paul McCarthy** was born in
  1945 and raised in Salt Lake City. He first established a multi-faceted
  artistic practice which sought to break the limitations of painting by using
  unorthodox materials such as bodily fluids and food. He has since become known
  for visceral, often hauntingly humorous work through performance, photography,
  film and video, sculpture, drawing, and painting. For 18 years, McCarthy
  taught performance, video, installation, and art history in the New Genres
  Department at UCLA, where he influenced future generations of west coast
  artists. He has exhibited extensively worldwide. "
