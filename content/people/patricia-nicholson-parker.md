short_bio: Artistic and community organizer and dancer **Patricia Nicholson
  Parker** is steeped in the aesthetic of free jazz with an attention to
  spiritual and social responsibility. In 1981, she choreographed and organized
  “A Thousand Cranes Peace Opera,” with 1,000 children performing in Dag
  Hammarskjold Plaza for the opening of the Special Sessions on Disarmament; in
  the mid- and late-1980s, she responded to a lack of visibility for free jazz
  by helping to organize the Sound Unity Festivals. In 1996, she founded Arts
  for Art (AFA) and the Vision Festival to promote and advocate for free jazz,
  raising awareness through this notable and uncommonly visible platform. Since
  then, AFA has grown to be a movement that supports hundreds of artists
  annually working with the free jazz aesthetic.
