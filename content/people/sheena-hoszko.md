short_bio: Based in Tio'tia:ke/Mooniyaang/Montréa, **Sheena Hoszko** is a
  sculptor and anti-prison organizer. Her art practice examines the power
  dynamics and violence of geographical, architectural, and psychological sites,
  informed by her family's experiences with incarceration, the military, and
  mental illness. Employing strategies of post-minimalism to draw attention to
  the politics of space and material, Hoszko primarily uses rented and reusable
  materials, which re-enter the world as non-art after a project is complete.
  Hoszko has exhibited nationally and internationally at the Musée d'art
  contemporain de Montréal and La Ferme du Buisson in Paris, among others.
  Hoszko was named to the 2021 Sobey Longlist and is currently a Ph.D. student
  in Cultural Studies at Queen's University, Ontario.
