short_bio: "Contemporary American abstract painter **Chris Martin**'s wide range
  of material and imagery is drawn from Buddhist mandalas, the landscapes of the
  Catskills, and the legacy of Abstract Expressionism. Martinâ€™s works attempt to
  deal with the psychological internalizations of spirituality and memory, using
  formalism in a way similar to both Alfred Jensen and Thomas Nozkowski. The
  artist regularly incorporates unconventional materials into his work, such as
  textiles, glitter, and vinyl records, as evidenced in Sweet Dreams (2nd Pillow
  Painting) (2009), a canvas where six affixed pillows are covered in bright
  neon paint. Martin lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. "
