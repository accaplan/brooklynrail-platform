short_bio: Artist **Tamara Gonzales** works with a variety of painted patterned
  motifs both in figuration and abstraction. Textiles and nature often inspire
  her works, while others are created through her own generative mark-making on
  paper or canvas. Over the last ten years Gonzalesâ€™ travels to Peru, and her
  visionary experiences and friendships with the Shipibo people have become a
  source of both inspiration and collaboration in her work. Working in her
  studio in Brooklyn and upstate New York, Gonzales develops her own visual
  language, resulting in a wonderful mixture of exuberant color, energetic line,
  and archetypal imagery.
