short_bio: Through assemblage and juxtaposition, **Troy Montes-Michie** (b.
  1985) engages black consciousness, Latinx experience, immigration, and
  queerness. Utilizing textiles, garments and archival paper, from newsprint to
  pornography, Montes-Michie subverts dominant narratives by placing past and
  present in confrontation. Referencing a rule of camouflage known as
  “disruptive patterning” which works by breaking up the outlines of an object
  with a strongly contrasting pattern, he investigates the ways in which bodies
  of marginalized communities are frequently erased and fetishized. His work has
  recently been exhibited at the Institute for Contemporary Art (Richmond), The
  MAC (Belfast), and many other institutions. Montes-Michie is a Lecturer in the
  Visual Arts Program at Princeton University.
