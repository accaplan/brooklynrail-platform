short_bio: "The work of **Rirkrit Tiravanija** has not stopped questioning the
  format of artworks and the exhibition system. A mix of performance, sculpture,
  installation, and more, with Tiravanija, the artistic space transforms into a
  place of social interaction. Frequently immaterial, his work invents new
  connections in a world based on reciprocity, conviviality, and hospitality.
  Whether transforming art centers and galleries into banquets, printing
  workshops, or pirate radio stations, the artist enjoys overcoming the usual
  spatial and temporal limitations of the “white cube.” Tiravanija has been
  granted with numerous awards including the Hugo Boss Prize from the Solomon R.
  Guggenheim Museum, the National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist
  Fellowship, among many others. "
