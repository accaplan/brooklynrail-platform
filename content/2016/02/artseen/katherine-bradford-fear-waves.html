Elevated above seawater
  The statuesque &ldquo;Blond&rsquo;s [towering] in the Sun [as a] Lifeguard.&rdquo; 
  Sitting on the chair with her bikini, made of three dabs of Naples yellow,
  She welcomes two friendly swimmers to her vast pool.</p>
<p>
They happily leave their worried bodies to drip, hover, sail horizontally
  In the heavenly <em>Floaters</em>, against the infinite horizon,
  Under the static, well-lit constellation,
  Encouraged to unwind in this cosmic theater.</p>
<p>
Ah, the first time we swim&#151;swimming has its own
  Law of gravity. Sometimes take a deep breath 
  To anticipate the luminosity of eclipsing bodies and stars.
  What a pity for those who never learned how to float and swim!
  Orbits of diving board springs on some occasions disrupt the
  <span style="margin-left:340px;"><em>Majestic horizontal plan</em>.</span></p>
<p>
Milky water gently bathes the happy population of seasoned 
  <em>Blue Swimmers </em>and fish. 
  Her &lsquo;lightness of being&rsquo; has engendered this 
  Masterful comic of the deep blue sea (that only she has seen).</p>
<p>
She, he, heshe <em>Couple Swim</em> off the left edge of an intimate vista against
  <span style="margin-left:180px;">The sun&rsquo;s egg-yolk eye of endless potential.</span> 
  Why not swim upward toward the sun without
  <span style="margin-left:180px;">The worry of waxed wings?</span>
  There, some of us notice <em>Surf Party</em> is an everyday affair
  <span style="margin-left:180px;">For Gods and mortals alike.</span></p>
<p>
Why have a <em>Fear of Waves</em>? A mere temporary cleaning agent,
  They have cleared off a woebegone dinner table in favor of
  A playful democracy of aquarian unity. </p>
<p>
Paint drips wishing to replace the water&rsquo;s splash cry out
  <span style="margin-left:180px;">With exquisite innocence.</span>
  <span style="margin-left:120px;"><em>Fathers </em>float in mid air</span>
  <span style="margin-left:80px;">Look collectively downward toward the <em>Surfer</em></span>
  <span style="margin-left:30px;">At 70 degrees, and <em>Swim Team Outer Space</em> at 45.</span></p>
<p>
		My math is hopeless, my father once told me when I was ten. So what! 
  Why bother to connect point and lines to plane?
  Kandinsky, Picasso, and Guston must have first raised the alarm
  <span style="margin-left:180px;">That became unending esteem.</span>
  <span style="margin-left:120px;">Here empty space fills volumes of the transfixed void.</span> 
  <span style="margin-left:80px;">People in boats, ships, liners, and other floating forms</span>
  <span style="margin-left:30px;">Are set free to swim whichever way, and whatever direction they please.</span>
  WHAT A PLEASURE! WHAAAAAAAAAAAT A PLEASURE!</p>
