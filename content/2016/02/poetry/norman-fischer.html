title: Poem After Reading Eileen&nbsp;Myles

I know you&rsquo;re not you &#151;
  this is me &#151; here are a pack
  of lies about sitting down
  on this chair &#151;
  There&rsquo;s a setting for this
  it&rsquo;s here I&rsquo;m a poet so
  this must be a cafe, single
  tree at top of hill
  invisible
  I mean
  words, music, evoke
  feeling, mood, here I am talking 
  to poets, that&rsquo;s not even
  thinking I mean to say
  this or that to anyone
  It&rsquo;s in the park</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.8em;">
Eileen is the boss not that she&rsquo;s
  bossy or trying to be bossy but still well
  these words stammer on my lips
  she says as she puts her foot down
  here on the
  ground 
  when you fall down 
  on the ground 
  you use the ground 
  to get up
  or you can use the sky
  to yank yourself up
  or gently employ the space
  between things &#151;
  that&rsquo;s me &#151; between things &#151;
  people have become
  much older than before
  things are getting complicated
  just as perplexing as they need to be 
  Several gulls
  wheel overhead I stirred a blue heron 
  whose wings unfolded loud so close
  This isn&rsquo;t about my mood
  There&rsquo;s nothing anyone can do about it
  she&rsquo;s driving in her car probably
  far distances stopping now and
  then
  to write this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.8em;">
Then the day began much as it
  always does pre-dawn followed
  by dawn then full light and
  its aftermath, the doings of a life
  with a mood perforated by
  thinking: what tune
  of thinking yourself to be 
  as a fact 
  you are not your demographic
  you are not a consumer
  nor are you a producer you are not
  a product of your circumstances
  the doctor
  says you are a patient
  your mother her child
  the poet a reader or a poet
  the mechanic a car or the owner
  of a car or another piece of machinery
  All the labor-saving devices 
  must be repaired &#151; 
  on a planet limited
  by apparent materiality how
  sustain the unlimited economic growth
  necessary to produce &ldquo;jobs&rdquo;&nbsp; 
  What jobs! 
  All thinking depends on a body 
  that propels one
  forth into further trouble and
  eventual demise all creatures eat
  so kill and are killed by the
  very fact 
  So don&rsquo;t need jobs! 
  Thus the
  day unfolds 
  Darkness descends, it&rsquo;s 
  emotional Who would wander into this
  cafe to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured 
  it out! I know what it is!
  I know what to do!&rdquo; ?</p>
