  Lately I find myself talking to a lot of people about how different things were in Los Angeles&#151;and its art world&#151;ten years ago. For roughly the past ten years, which is also roughly the time I&rsquo;ve been working as a critic, I&rsquo;ve been keeping a daily log of every show I see. In fact, it was started with that purpose: to keep track of the seemingly vast amount of art I was looking at, IRL. The earliest log I can locate begins in March of 2006, coinciding with the purchase of a new laptop. Over the past decade, I&rsquo;ve started to add a lot more to the log, but it started with exhibitions, studio visits, films, things I was reading, and the occasional lunch meeting or fancy art dinner. In a transgression of my usual privacy regarding this daily log, I thought it might be revealing to see what the world (well, my world) looked like ten years ago. So, this is one month from 2006, without editing. A few artist names are no longer familiar. Many of the galleries I frequented have disappeared; the galleries are in (mostly) different neighborhoods. There weren&rsquo;t as many galleries then, and I could usually get to most of them. Now there are twice as many, spread out all over the city, and I can only see a fraction of what I used to see. (Ten years ago, I was also working at USC. My, how things have changed there!) In 2006, there were days I didn&rsquo;t account for. That&rsquo;s changed too, for better or worse.</li></ol>
