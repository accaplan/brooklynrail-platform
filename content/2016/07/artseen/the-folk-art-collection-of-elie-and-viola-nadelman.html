<p>In 1937, Elie and Viola Nadelman's&nbsp;<em>Museum of Folk and Peasant Arts</em>&nbsp;was an original in practically every way.&nbsp;Today, the&nbsp;contents are still quite delicious; every piece exceptional, acquired while practically nobody else was looking, each cousin to a common aesthetic purpose, that one can still feel, even in the selection exhibited here (the Society purchased only a large fragment of the whole, reputed to have been more than 15,000 items).&nbsp;Strong feelings and deep purposes are still restless among these things.&nbsp;The original Museum was the project of an artist, and even, it has been said, his &ldquo;masterpiece.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> !!img1!!
<p>Born in Warsaw, Nadelman (1882-1946) made his way to Paris before the First World War, where he was a pathfinding modernist in the circle of the Steins.&nbsp;As an &eacute;migr&eacute; to New York, it seemed he would ride the crest of the modern, but in fact he was already a stranger in every circle, in the Parisian avant-garde, and in New York as well, even as a leader of the most up to date conservatives.&nbsp;By 1929, married well and doing well, largely on lucrative portrait commissions, he held the art world at arm&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp;At his death in 1946 he was well out of touch and only the single-handed efforts of Lincoln Kirstein have kept his name alive until now.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Just&nbsp;now he is getting with-it again.&nbsp;Galerie&nbsp;Buchholz collects him,&nbsp;and represents&nbsp;his estate, here and in Europe.&nbsp;Perhaps now at last his reputation will come to rest where it belongs, on his still-underknown late work, &ldquo;the dolls,&rdquo; roughly a thousand unmounted small plaster figures only inches high.&nbsp;These profoundly ambiguous beings, scattered between new and old, boy and girl, matter and metaphysics, were produced <em>after</em> the demise of the Folk and Peasant Arts Museum and in mourning for it.&nbsp;As a body, they are an unvisited monument of 20th century modern art.&nbsp;Once aware of the dolls, one sees all Nadelman&rsquo;s prior activity as a prelude to them, the former Museum and this exhibition included.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> !!img2!!
<p>The exhibition contents raise an audible babble of forms and suggestions.&nbsp;Their busy murmur is diametrically opposite the silence and solitude of Nadelman&rsquo;s youth in Paris, &ldquo;living on plaster&rdquo; (said Gide, after visiting his studio), where he was no collector (so far as we know) but a producer alone, remarkable for his questing philosophical focus on essential form.&nbsp;There is an abrupt philosophical contrast between Nadelman&rsquo;s Europe and New York, between the single artist and the married artist-collector/collaborator.&nbsp;Recent scholarship and the excellent exhibition catalog open our eyes to the unsolitary burden of Folk and Peasant Arts Museum-building. Tables in the catalog appendices itemize the dealers, the travel, and the chronology of the Institution, but only barely suggest the ever-crowding stuff, the disorder, the moving, packing, unpacking, labeling, the miscellaneous correspondence, museum planning, construction, installation; all of which was subtracted from Nadelman&rsquo;s practice.&nbsp;<em>How did he stand it?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the twenties, he was not the only artist collecting &ldquo;folk&rdquo; (for want of a better term, we&rsquo;re not there yet) art.&nbsp;Other moderns were collecting backward, as they pressed forward, but Nadelman&rsquo;s collecting, uniquely, was&nbsp;<em>within</em> his creative practice.&nbsp;The rhymes between the collection and his own work are more than loving, and witty; he had&nbsp;set about total awareness of a universe of art and objects, low and high, so by his middle work, the museum-building artist practiced as an artist without walls, inhabiting every viewpoint, from every continent,&nbsp;locale, culture and epoch simultaneously, as if all time and place were one&nbsp;head, and under the eye of one staggeringly sophisticated observer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The exhibition includes a welcome selection of Nadelman&rsquo;s mid-career works, from the late teens and twenties, in carved wood, bronze and electro-plated plaster, all touched with the artist&rsquo;s signature freehand painting.&nbsp;With them placed among Museum objects one gets the funny feeling that all the exhibition contents, whatever their origin, are the work of <em>one</em> hand.&nbsp;As if a single insinuated intelligence, prolifically various and reinventive, had guided all hands.&nbsp;Nadelman, having recognized the charm, was both its poet and one more suborned practicien, only more self-possessed than the others.&nbsp;Again and again he picked up another maker&rsquo;s theme, saying <em>May I?&nbsp;May we try this once more?&nbsp;Your song, of course, but I hear another voice, may we reveal it?&nbsp;There is something more here, let me bring out more fully what you would not have known better&#133;</em></p>
<p>The Museum could not survive the Crash. In 1937, under duress, the Nadelmans sold the bulk of the Collection to the New York Historical Society.&nbsp;Elie confessed that &ldquo;the dismantling of the Folk Art Museum did also dismantle something in me.&rdquo;&nbsp;But the demise of the Museum made matter and space for his own work.&nbsp;The dolls began as straightforward models for editions of small works for all, to be mass produced in contemporary plastics, like Bakelite. &nbsp;But the project slipped away from the crowd and back to the consolation of philosophy, and solitude.&nbsp;The teeming multiplicity of the dolls recalled the Museum and one by one they soothed the losses of the collection. Alone again, Nadelman prepared his final art, an old man&rsquo;s game, for himself, and a few.</p>
