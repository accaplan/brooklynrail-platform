<p>I first heard Pylon in 2007. I had just moved to Pylon&rsquo;s home of Athens, Georgia, the year that DFA had reissued the band&rsquo;s 1980 debut album, <em>Gyrate</em>. Aptly named <em>Gyrate Plus</em>, the reissue opens with tracks from the band&rsquo;s first single, &ldquo;Cool/Dub,&rdquo; from 1979, and closes with a select track from an out-of-print EP followed by an unreleased studio demo. My ex-almost girlfriend played me the disc. We nodded along to &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; and once the spastic rhythms of &ldquo;Dub&rdquo; compelled her to obey the album&rsquo;s titular command, I was hooked. I was nineteen and na&iuml;ve. I had deferred college and moved to Athens to be in a band. I was making sandwiches for a living and paying $300 rent. I was going to be a professional musician! Now an uninhibited older women was seducing me to the emasculating howls of Vanessa Briscoe Hay. It was my first taste of the <em>townie</em>. She ended whatever we had when another of her almost boyfriends came back from tour and threatened to kill me with an ax. </p>
<p>In advance of Chunklet&rsquo;s release last month of <em>Pylon Live</em>, a recording of the 1983 performance that marked the band&rsquo;s first formal hiatus, I revisited Pylon&rsquo;s 1980s albums&#151;after <em>Gyrate </em>came <em>Chomp</em>, in 1983; DFA reissued it as <em>Chomp More</em> in 2009. I found the music at least as compelling as my ex-almost girlfriend had: Michael Lachowski&rsquo;s pneumatic and melodic bass; Curtis Crowe&rsquo;s punctual yet unpredictable drumming; Randall Bewley&rsquo;s sharp and apposite riffs; and Vanessa Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s commanding vocals&#151;an array of growls, brays, coos, and squeals&#151;advising to &ldquo;Read a book / Don&rsquo;t be afraid&rdquo; or warning that &ldquo;We eat dub for breakfast.&rdquo; It all remains instantly yet deeply gratifying, like all great rock music. </p>
<p>Live albums typically rely on interpretation, improvisation, or translation of studio material&#151;or some combination thereof. I was fortunate enough to see Pylon perform in Athens&#151;the band started performing again shortly after the release of <em>Gyrate Plus</em>&#151;so I surmised, correctly, that <em>Live</em> would hinge on translation: capturing Pylon&rsquo;s driving and melodic minimalism, the aural equivalent of four Newton&rsquo;s cradles set in a square and swinging in concert. </p>
<p>The album succeeds on the whole, although at times it can feel like listening to Pylon with gauze in your ears. The band&rsquo;s 1980s LPs aren&rsquo;t clean or over-produced, but <em>Live</em> lacks the fidelity that amplifies these albums&rsquo; intensity. Nevertheless, the best moments on <em>Live</em> singe the gauze&#151;and your nerves&#151;and showcase the artistic vitality of four musicians able to capture such intensity on tape. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beep&rdquo; is a fast and frenetic riff-fest, melodic like Television but less fancy, more potlikker than <em>fond</em>, aided by Lachowski&rsquo;s chugging lines and Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s growl of &ldquo;beep beep,&rdquo; which is punched up by Crowe&rsquo;s banging. On &ldquo;No Clocks,&rdquo; a song about lazing with your lover in bed the morning after, Lachowski&rsquo;s bass rings behind Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s mantric chorus of &ldquo;No clocks no / No clocks no.&rdquo; &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; rollicks to a walking rock bass punctuated by Bewley&rsquo;s analog shimmer-riff&#151;a direct rebuke of U2&rsquo;s The Edge, if I&rsquo;ve ever heard one&#151;and Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s ominous, municipal warning: &ldquo;Danger / Be careful / Be cautious.&rdquo; Then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Working Is No Problem,&rdquo; in which Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s growling delivery, stretching the lyric &ldquo;working&rdquo; into a lingering guttural moan, is enough to salvage any off-day at the office. </p>
<p>But perhaps Pylon&rsquo;s peculiar vitality is best displayed by &ldquo;M Train,&rdquo; the stark and catchy B-side to their second single from 1981 and side A closer on <em>Chomp</em>. To say &ldquo;M Train&rdquo; is defined by Bewley&rsquo;s bass chorus riff (he and Lachowski switch instruments for the song)&#151;which imprints itself on your mind like a mnemonic device&#151;wouldn&rsquo;t do justice to Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s equally catchy train-whistle chorus; nor to Crowe&rsquo;s steadfast drumming and Lachowski&rsquo;s atmospherics. Live, the song gains in character what it loses in studio production. Bewley&rsquo;s bass is tinny and sharp, Crowe&rsquo;s drums loose, Briscoe Hay&rsquo;s vocals muddled and snarling, and Lachowski&rsquo;s guitar free to overrun what is essentially a pop tune with a trebly warble. &ldquo;Woo woo,&rdquo; sings the crowd during the intro over Bewley&rsquo;s line, hinting at the choruses to come. Woo woo, indeed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Lachowski has said that his &ldquo;favorite Pylon is live Pylon.&rdquo; The performance I saw in 2007 was certainly memorable&#151;like Briscoe Hay, my seductress&rsquo;s name was also Vanessa; oh, how cathartic it was to sing along to &ldquo;M-Train&rdquo; live, belting, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a party doll / I don&rsquo;t care for that girl at all [. . .] Woo woo!&rdquo;&#151;and <em>Pylon Live</em> captures some of that feeling. Still, I respectfully disagree with Lachowski. The band&rsquo;s studio albums are simply too distinct, too timeless, too fit to define the memories of some foolish nineteen-year-old or of anyone else who has yet to discover them. Then again, Pylon only made three albums, and <em>Live </em>is both a welcome addition and a fine introduction. Fan or newcomer, I&rsquo;d pick it up. </p>
