POEM FOR VERITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Looking up to watch the planes ascending, I want
  Day to value night, feel the move solidly, and to leave here finally
  &amp; also for Britain to explode like a birthday cake to the
  Tune of Jerusalem, inane flecks of meringue in your hair</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m proud of but there are six things
  We live among: irritation, agitation, death, dissociation, and
  Two good abstractions only &ldquo;the oppressed&rdquo; would know.
  It&rsquo;s not like me to know but I do know,</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">
<em>No one told me essays on Marxism and poetry would be hated</em>
  <em>But theory really does undermine what they do! </em>
  <em>Since no one seems ensconced in art</em>
  <em>But we are all enclosed by value&#151;</em></p>
<p>
Even if the value can&rsquo;t capture what we do and given
  That the programme era is a whack puffed up wet balloon,
  And that if we are living in a time after Objectivist poets
  We are also living in a time after many things now, now</p>
<p>
Light years away. The working day is no longer your friend
  The friend no longer wants to know your experience
  Experience lies to your face then plagiarizes you, supine in
  The face of it, the sad marvels we&rsquo;re indebted to it for.</p>

VALUE AT TWILIGHT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Every feminist man thinks he is a good friend. 
  He wouldn't hit a woman, nor rape her. Nor kill her,
  but maybe he would write something to pause the brain, a
  Heraclitean litany or regular love song. Save her a song in the spirit
  of universalism that she would comprehend&#151;
  All my abstract labour is on the mountain top. So fuck unto yourself.</p>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He wouldn't file a woman down, or forget Ivana Hoffman&rsquo;s, or
  Sappho's scream, that Mary Kelly had a fit was the right way
  to set fire to the gravy boat of your dreams. You say get me,
  I&rsquo;ll wash your staircase I won&rsquo;t touch your guitar, he says here&rsquo;s the rub:
  I love you more when you&rsquo;re doing taxes but your 
  visa ran out, my golden ratio garbage-rumour, negation-scrub-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What&rsquo;s wrong with you, largesse? What&rsquo;s up. A man&rsquo;s abstraction
  from the vaults always spews hot sauce. Take the case of Putin,
  who slapped his wife just as the European Union collapsed.
  He threatened to leave the Ukraine gas pipeline to pump
  love poison into what became a fear of mouths. Vote. Don&rsquo;t
  vote! For Lyric Poetry and Society and the grace of any god</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Because every white woman can think she is out of there, not
  eaten inside by the Enlightenment, descendant semantics, a kind 
  of no-strings accumulation where to destroy men is merely / to dream
  with them, and to quell them is to ally with them against
  all women who&rsquo;ve learned: <em>mujeres enfuricidas</em>&#33; Sisters&#33; The crisis is ours
  too: abandon any house, explode the base, it was just a vain idea</p>
