<p>Painter Helen Frankenthaler was known for her personal and spirited postcard correspondence with family and friends, described by her as &ldquo;postcardisms.&rdquo; Found in the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation Archives is a volley of incoming and outgoing postcards between Frankenthaler and Jock Truman, Betty Parsons Gallery Director from 1961 &#150; 1974, written between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, which document their light-hearted and personal exchanges.</p>
<p>While Frankenthaler often sent postcards to Truman picturing buildings or cityscapes, he preferred vintage postcards from the turn of the century. Along with a group of vintage leather postcards, he sent a note reading: &ldquo;Dear Favorite Painter: Good luck, love &amp; kisses, an admirer, &rsquo;66 Truman.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Delighted by the leather postcards, Frankenthaler responded with an update on life at her home on East 94th Street:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">June 1st [1967]. Jock dear &#150; How&rsquo;s this for openers? Thank you for your face in the crowd yesterday. Right now, it&rsquo;s 8 a.m. and I&rsquo;ve just watered new shrubs in the garden and am having my &ldquo;Special K&rdquo; while the new poodle &ldquo;Martell&rdquo; lies at my feet with a bone. (Hardly a scene for the Divine Sarah).* But spring! And soon to my Provincetown studio, and the Bay. I tremble at the thought of your leather card. love x &#150; Helen.</p>
<p>Generally, we send postcards while on vacation or away from home, but on these occasions, both Frankenthaler and Truman were writing from New York, enjoying staying in touch via postcardisms. </p>
