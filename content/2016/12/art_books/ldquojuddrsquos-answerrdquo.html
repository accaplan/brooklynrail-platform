title: '&ldquo;Judd&rsquo;s Answer&rdquo;'

<p>Donald Judd&rsquo;s terse writing opens up an enormously generous field of no. </p>


<p>In a characteristically blunt 1967 statement he writes: </p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything special about squares, which I don&rsquo;t use, or cubes. They certainly don&rsquo;t have any intrinsic meaning or superiority. One thing though, cubes are a lot easier to make than spheres. The main virtue of geometric shapes is that they aren&rsquo;t organic, as all art otherwise is. A form that&rsquo;s neither geometric nor organic would be a great discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judd begins by stripping his subject of any distinction&#8212;the square won&rsquo;t be upheld for its purity of form or its democratizing evenhandedness here. He continues with a series of negations and what returns, once content is shaken off form like so much dust, is utility and difference. The cube is a no-fuss form, and geometry a useful refutation of art&rsquo;s classical function as an imitation of nature. </p>

<p>What Judd ends with, however, is a question that seems almost to beg for a supernatural answer. It&rsquo;s an impossible question&#8212;most good questions are&#8212;but here the impossibility follows as a matter of course from the all-encompassing binary of its mobilizing terms. One way out of this binary is to reach each pole and keep walking. </p>

<p>What frames Judd&rsquo;s geometries? In his text it is clearly bodies. There is the speaking subject&#8212;the text&rsquo;s inaugural I&#8212;and there are the hands that make cubes and those that struggle to make spheres; there is the evaluating body and the discoverer. The reverse line can also be traced. The crib, the city grid, and the coffin: the body is produced, used, held by, and sometimes abandoned to its geometries. But finding each pole of a binary always already nestled within its purported other doesn&rsquo;t yet give us Judd&rsquo;s third term. What lies outside of everything that exists? </p>

<p>If the answer is nothing, then the question shifts to what gives form to nothing. </p>

<p>In describing Bontecou&rsquo;s canvases that frame a central void, Judd writes, &ldquo;The image is an object, a grim, abyssal one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The dominant image, the central hole surrounded by canvas, is not primarily allusive and descriptive. The black hole does not allude to a black hole; it is one.&rdquo; Why then the recourse to the idea of image in the first place? Perhaps because a form can&rsquo;t <em>be </em>nothing, yet an artwork can give image to the loss of its own structure. It can create a frame in which to present a hole. The hole itself, the absence of form, is neither geometric nor organic. Bontecou&rsquo;s no is Judd&rsquo;s answer. </p>
