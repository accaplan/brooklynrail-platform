<p>On the first day of the end of the world, all the journalists ate their words and bit their tongues. Then they created new lies which they prefaced with &ldquo;As I have said all along&#133;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the second day of the end of the world, all the women woke up nauseous, pregnant with the idea they carried a demon in their belly. That somehow they were to blame.</p>
<p>On the third day of the end of the world, non-educated white male voters passed into unconsciousness after two days of straight drinking and grabbing their crotches in salute to each other.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the end of the world, the adults disappeared. The children were left alone with their tablets and phones. They texted, Mom? Dad? But received no reply.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the end of the world, a demon god emerged from the sun and eulogized the missing parents while he levitated over the inner cities.</p>
<p>On the sixth day of the end of the world, those same journalists, all the women, non-educated white male voters, the children with their tablets, and some of the missing parents, were rounded up for the inauguration of the demon god from the sun.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of the end of the world, the sun did not come up. Or if it did, no one could see it because of a giant wall. The demon god from the sun had in fact managed to build a giant wall. One that blocked out the sun.</p>
