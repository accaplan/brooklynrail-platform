title: GHOST STORIES The Films of Jos&eacute;&nbsp;Luis&nbsp;Guer&iacute;n
---

<p>Spanish director Jos&eacute; Luis Guer&iacute;n is one of contemporary cinema&rsquo;s foremost practitioners of the documentary/fiction hybrid; and Anthology Film Archive&rsquo;s near-complete retrospective of his films is ideal relief from the ugly campaign pageantry glutting the dog days of our absurd American summer. A true child of the Lumi&egrave;re brothers, Guer&iacute;n is a filmmaker for whom the cinematic image retains an inherently sensitizing power, but he is also a child of Ford and George Cukor: a dramatist and a showman. Each of his films is a ghost story of sorts, an invocation of the dead and gone&#151;absence made manifest. His singular, destabilizing merger of the fictive and the v&eacute;rit&eacute; is a decidedly old-fashioned effort to bring us back to first principles, to a prelapsarian time when the word &ldquo;cinema&rdquo; could still evoke a newfangled, mysterious, and slightly miraculous mechanism. </p>

<p>A highlight of the retrospective is the little-seen <em>Train Of Shadows</em> (1997), his second feature after the gentle cine-essay <em>Innisfree</em> (1990, also included). <em>Shadows</em> purports to be a tribute to G&eacute;rard Fleury, a Parisian lawyer and avid amateur filmmaker who, as an opening title explains, &ldquo;died of circumstances that remain unclear&rdquo; after leaving home one day in 1930 to shoot landscapes next to a nearby lake. What seems initially to be an honorific piece of cinematic vandalism&#151;allegedly &ldquo;restored&rdquo; Fleury home movies alternating with contemporary color footage of his family estate&#151;morphs into an eerie structuralist palimpsest. Arguably Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s most rigorous work, <em>Shadows </em>nevertheless thrums with impish, palpable pleasure in both narrative gamesmanship and the tactile properties of celluloid itself. </p>
<p><em>Work In Progress</em> (2001) manages to find the cosmos in a few city blocks, as Guer&iacute;n charts a year in the life of a construction project in a gentrifying Barcelona neighborhood. On one level, the film is a work of a dispassionate ethnographer with an obsessive attention to process: to the arduous job of demolition and building, to the bodies of workers as they go about their business. But it is also a film about a (possibly dying) community, and Guer&iacute;n peppers his documentary footage with mini-narratives involving the construction staff and the soon-to-be displaced denizens of the surrounding building. <em>Work</em> emerges as a movie cast firmly in the neorealist mode; one scene in particular, a pre-construction archeological dig in which the remains of Roman soldiers are unearthed beneath the proposed work site, explicitly evokes Rossellini&rsquo;s <em>Voyage</em> <em>To Italy </em>in its clear-eyed mordancy. Something of a companion to <em>Work</em>, the short <em>Memories of a Morning</em> (2011) is an unsentimental and moving reflection on the morning that one of Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s neighbors threw himself from a window onto a heavily trafficked city square. Taken together, the films are portraits of city living that manage to combine close-to-the ground reportage with nearly deity-like perspective on the urban ephemeral. </p>
<p>Another city symphony, <em>In the City of Sylvia</em> (2007) follows a young man on a quest in sunny summer Strasbourg. He seems to be an art student; we see him drawing a lot, sketching various women at a caf&eacute; (a surrogate for Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s watchful camera) until he finally spies a particular brunette and rather ineptly follows her through streets strewn with dryly comic obstacles. That&rsquo;s basically it, but in Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s hands this nearly wordless film becomes a meditation on the aggressivity of watching and the unreliability of memory. In the penultimate scene, the artist finally speaks to his muse, who abruptly informs him that she doesn&rsquo;t like to be followed (which the camera has been doing right alongside him) and that she isn&rsquo;t the woman he imagines her to be. Indeed, by the end of the film we wonder if the &ldquo;Sylvia&rdquo; he mistakes her for ever existed at all, other than as a ghostly composite of fondly remembered time and place. An extension on an earlier docu-poem composed entirely of still images (<em>Some Photographs From The City of Sylvia</em>, 2007), Guerin&rsquo;s most well-known film outside of his home country plays a little like <em>Marienbad </em>by way of Tati, but has a peculiar, haunted mien all its own.</p>
<p>His newest film, <em>Academy of the Muses</em> (2015) is another exercise in cerebral voyeurism, one that further complicates <em>Sylvia</em>&rsquo;s inveterate girl-watching by giving copious, polyphonic voice to the watched. On the surface, it&rsquo;s Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s most conventional movie&#151;a Rohmeresque campus comedy about a poetry course in the form of a training class for muses of all sexes, run by a coyly sybaritic Italian philologist who engages his down-for-whatever students in an ongoing dialogue on the conventions of lived romance as dictated by literary tradition. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no escaping language,&rdquo; he tells them, which is especially true in the unofficial office hours he holds with a few of his fetching female pupils in the front seat of his car. His wife, meanwhile, chides him for &ldquo;preaching&rdquo; in class and, and not unreasonably, questions his motives for following this particular line of inquiry. </p>
<p>As in all of Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s films, the ethnographic and the fictive are so deeply intertwined as to be indistinguishable: the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; feel like seminars in real time, and a documentary field study on Sardinian shepherds is a crucial mid-stream rupture of the film&rsquo;s otherwise urbane academic groove. Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s signature banal uncanny is everywhere, exemplified in his tendency to shoot conversations from the outside of buildings, through hyper-reflective windows that transform his characters&rsquo; bodies into abstract, teeming canvases upon which the lives around them are projected. It is tempting to read the professor as a fictional stand-in for the director&#151;a teacher (Guer&iacute;n himself is an educator) whose relationship to his subject is in constant and necessary flux, whose attention ranges from mandarin distance to self-implicating intimacy. &ldquo;I believe Arcadia is still possible,&rdquo; he tells one student, and one can see Guer&iacute;n&rsquo;s entire <em>oeuvre </em>as a kind of Arcadian/Marxist effort to re-sensitize his audience to the power of the image and the image&rsquo;s place in the sociopolitical whorl. His brand of cool humanism is a rarity on our screens right now, and we are lucky to have him. Go. </p>
