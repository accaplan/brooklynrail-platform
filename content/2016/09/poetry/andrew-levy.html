<p style="line-height:2em;">
The resting place mobilized for pearl making, the fortunate fall.&nbsp; 
  We see fling in fact, the stone which the builders refused come to be 
  the petty tyrant who makes our life hell, the vehicle.&nbsp; The cornerstone 
  pushes against the spot where the bodies fell.&nbsp; Our semiautomatic 
  has to fix this, ring and reaction as reminder, the video of the choppy, 
  the way time like corn syrup is lived in our world.&nbsp; A reminder 
  of whatever you were doing, reminders of our breath, of your own roar. 
  Helicopters and bombs bring you back to your true self, pushing 
  against the spot where you fell.&nbsp; Repeat it, amplify it, develop it further.&nbsp; 
  Hope it doesn&rsquo;t happen again, feel guilty.&nbsp; The cold and the humidity 
  goes out of tune, becomes lower in pi and pitch, becomes the bow&rsquo;s weight.&nbsp; 
  Detune the sub-basement even further, the harmonic blunder, abstract 
  color and pattern peppered with stories, other-worldly microscopic&nbsp; 
  seeded by mistakes, the discovery of penicillin, the careless handling 
  of a photographic plate, an alchemical quark, unalterable peace. 
  Nutcase ahoy, going bonkers in blustery drizzle, a fistful of soggy aphids, 
  a worm returned to soil. &nbsp;Go tell hell to hang up, go there to take an awful 
  beating.&nbsp; Reserve sixty-thousand charming elevators, lose track of gravity, 
  run across my globe an amputated sycamore bled dry.&nbsp; Trawl for leaves 
  feasibly optioned, be duplicitous at my beck and call.&nbsp; Commiserate 
  with fleece too painfully for a century further than the next clipper.&nbsp; 
  Give a soak watching a bunny, her chunky Gnostic rings owed money.&nbsp; 
  Buy a comfortable place and lie low like herpes.&nbsp; Evolve in microwaves.
  Share if you are sure you have truth.&nbsp; How can you share the grubby caf&eacute;, 
  a feisty stagger, the greyhound of language?&nbsp; Restore pony breeders, an 
  addled brain in so-called melting-pots.&nbsp; The dusty rectangle in the dome?&nbsp; 
  Nose-holes with clinical depression chlorinating bed-wetting?&nbsp; 
  Remember talking about something to establish something else.&nbsp; Begin 
  to see in a kind of Picasso multitudes of people.</p>

What we no longer say, fresh and sweet like a baby&rsquo;s breath
  the pull-back the inconsequalitative nothing good could come from
  knowing, broken Maya Deren lace and linen lord god my witness
  when I leave this place, girls so silly, water and cut okra stuck 
  on foreheads gumbo water what force of the new the older one gets 
  the closer one gets to the ground.&nbsp; Hands scarred blue from indigo dye, 
  bend down planted and hoeing in times of promises, the rich and 
  the poor, the powerful and the powerless, we the bridge they cross over, 
  the story going to come anytime we need change.&nbsp; Old man grand-
  daughter done come home, that shameless here-taker, mighty know-
  how suckle in the air just for fun, come back for something no dead 
  crab meat, public chicken seed time of life, deeds we do mighty harvest 
  fell into the hands of the lord, who they out there no surprises here, 
  earth not belong to man, what Trump-kind of believe that is.&nbsp; Family 
  sticks to the old ways.&nbsp; As much as I like the fish, I don&rsquo;t want to
  drown in that water, aqua take me by the hand be dead a long time,
  talk and write a letter, a glass of water come to me right on, real 
  backwater most desolate place on the earth, muddy waters the only 
  way for things to change people to keep moving, someone to
  depend on just to know on the white sand, near the surf you&rsquo;ll be 
  eaten soon like savages, haven&rsquo;t had good food in a long time, a new
  kind.&nbsp; Common as the fish in the sea.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough uncertainty 
  in life, don&rsquo;t tell something nothing, convince him, if you want to know 
  the wanderer was born dead, so beautiful uprooted dead.&nbsp; Big 
  broken umbrella extendable love prevents sits down overhear 
  all the answer, strange and not the desire lots of luggage.&nbsp; Moving into 
  a new day then damn everybody to hell. I&rsquo;m an educated person. 
  I pray to the moon, I pray to the sun.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Last Night </p> 
<p align="right" style="margin-top:-1em;font-size:10pt;margin-right:100px;">to Julie Patton </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
  Last night, 21-year-old Dylann Roof entered Emanuel AME 
  Church in Charleston South Carolina and asked to sit with Pastor 
  Clementa Pinckney, pulled up the horse a yard shy leaded thru 
  the scalp no time to mount cross bolts. That&rsquo;s what I heard, 
  whole didn&rsquo;t stop to shoot a tree for lumber, busted their falls bad. 
  Hushed with a handcart burnt black kindergarten euthanasia 
  five-star Taipei. Shrubs singing what a window was, kick boxed. 
  Your post grad grads are the worst, professors wipe their asses 
  babysitting genomed ears, a weaker growth in China. These guys 
  have &ldquo;a lot of secular headwinds&rdquo; mired in downtrend 
  head-n-shoulders. Sugar rush acquisitions. Latest and greatest 
  ultimate killing machine. Before this bond hearing conformism 
  can also destroy it, raised and trained and treated consumers. 
  Prepare an eating or drinking, procrastination to not-doing, the 
  allergies ego, its spiky, rotted bonfire door-banging alto bassoon. 
  Slaves, peasants, flagstones ignorance wealthy Buddha. We 
  as a nation, composers of the age, contradictions architects 
  perpetuated hate, an aquatint of marble towers, a crime the day 
  humanity shall have fulfilled its purpose. The demagogue 
  excused of that kingdom the honeymooned malady 
  rebuffed, burgled, everyone hurt, double-bladed, stroked, 
  encircled on the lookout bound for Switzerland five bottles 
  of wine to wear it. My ears flattered, protested, sentimental 
  injustice. Do something clumsy, indiscreet. This in not who 
  we are. This is who we are. The opening ritual becomes 
  everything we do and perceive. Say good-bye, walk out on 
  the stage, treat each solitary moral and anguish, the comedian&rsquo;s 
  invocation, mediums hip and concentration. Begin to move. 
  Return the Chinese boxes; check the total system of requisite 
  variety. On earth, small arms never arrive at truth.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">War of Life</p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
We&rsquo;ve fought for months to reform this broken system. &nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s unsettling all the same to learn that my employer is &nbsp;
(may be) spying on my private expressive activities&nbsp; &nbsp;
and expressive conduct. Have I completely misread what I think&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve experienced? The crawling severed hand prevents their escape. 
That's both weird and [offensive language] up. It&rsquo;s impossible&nbsp; 
to be a poet. I&rsquo;ll scan my passport and hope that suffices. Has 
violence taken the place of measurement? Once you get in, you 
can knock other people out? Don&rsquo;t bite the bullet, the idea 
behind the bullet, and become a contemptible snake. You don&rsquo;t &nbsp;
need a special day. You&rsquo;re a liar. I always do my own editing, 
locked in a room with no one to hear my words. They return&nbsp; 
from who knows where, they come back to me. They&nbsp; 
underlie emotions that undergird my belief in the heteronym, &nbsp;
being profoundly antithetical to the history and mission 
of literary institutions which proportion reservations less 
heuristic than confrontational. The blood is equal to the money&nbsp; &nbsp;
made. This is why facts are insufficient remedy for dislodging&nbsp; 
bullets from those who have weakly held positions. To get to 
the Climate Change Museum art dealers and their associates 
had to disappear. If there&rsquo;s life on other planets, then&nbsp; 
the earth is the Universe&rsquo;s insane asylum. I <em>felt</em> something&nbsp; 
was wrong the entire time, but I had possibly misread 
the situation in its entirety. Someday, there will be something 
that you just won&rsquo;t be able to do again, like straighten up.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m never going to get over it.

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Membership in the Masters of the Universe Club</p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
&ldquo;The really helpful things will not be done from the centre; they cannot &nbsp;
be done by big organizations; but they can be done by the people&nbsp; 
themselves&rdquo; (E.F. Schumacher). Assembly of the tiny pieces of wood &nbsp;
and word demands untold patience. I am a tree everyone may embrace;&nbsp; 
I offer the whiteness of the snow on my limbs, the nut inside&nbsp; 
the dream you throw into your bed, in the disquiet of an idea; I make&nbsp; &nbsp;
people footloose. Problems which have to be &ldquo;lived&rdquo; are only solved&nbsp; 
by death. One&rsquo;s mind becomes a kind of machine for grinding collections &nbsp;
of facts. Much that we expect to find, that is hard to explain, slips 
through the net in a way that is hard to explain. What is known loses its&nbsp; 
autonomy for the sake of what it is known as. Our Intelligence Monitoring &nbsp;
was among the email that won this year&rsquo;s National lottery award which 
was not claimed seriously. No one can write down a solution. Heightened&nbsp; 
societal exhibitions combating an apocalyptic army are <em>not</em> the unity <em>of</em>&nbsp; 
the essences. Membership in the Masters of the Universe Club depends on&nbsp; &nbsp;
those who died already. &ldquo;With the words going out like cells of a brain /&nbsp; 
with the cities growing over us like the earth,&rdquo; being brave let&rsquo;s no one&nbsp; 
off the grave. Earth is not a waiting room for souls. When poetic passages 
are guaranteed safety, the market for poetry is shadier, dismantling 
angelic communications of a secular form. The masters feel a completely 
different kind of comfort. Something in the test-tube must be madness, &nbsp;
something in the things, in the way of the force come out. Leaving the site&nbsp; 
of the dead, an unexpected breach sends Gerry back into the sky in search of &nbsp;
patient zero. The unexpected emails, the namable made to work for love. 
At the Universe Club the mudslide was hard. The fragility of the club&nbsp; 
and of its master&rsquo;s mortal remains is very difficult to recover. It is bitter and &nbsp;
sweet; it is given to a plenitude of further and divergent thoughts 
that circulate to unpredictable effect. </p>
