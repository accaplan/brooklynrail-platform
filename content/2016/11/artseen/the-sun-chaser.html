<p>
Dazzling, trembling with such exactitude,
<span style="margin-left:75px;">Clench, clutch, clasp, spellbindingly hugging</span>
<span style="margin-left:75px;">With visible affection,</span>
Each of these mountains was precipitously made 
<span style="margin-left:200px;">With flawless fibula.</span></p>
<p>
How high, how low must each rise
<span style="margin-left:40px;">To be lit by the burning sun?</span>
How thick, how thin must these particular fluorescent 
Pigments coat nature&rsquo;s exquisite filament?
How long, how quick must each terrestrial vertebrate
<span style="margin-left:75px;">Freeze in space before the deadline of</span>
<span style="margin-left:200px;">A confectioner&rsquo;s handiwork?</span></p>
<p>
<em>pink red orange yellow green mountain</em>
<em>orange yellow green blue pink red mountain</em>
<span style="margin-left:200px;">They anchor the central path,</span>
Welcoming stoned shepherds who have joined 
Maenads and satyrs in their mystic dance.</p>
<p>
Feverish grip flutters heavenward.
<em>white blue black mountain</em>
<em>white silver black mountain</em>
Sing their choruses in praise of 
<span style="margin-left:125px;">This rack of drunk mountaineers.</span></p>
<p>
Cloud puffs drift lazily above,
Bright wind with clean, crisp air,
I see <em>the sun at 4 pm </em>in equilibrium.
<span style="margin-left:125px;">Remember just now</span>
<span style="margin-left:200px;">What Baudelaire once wrote,</span>
&ldquo;The Poet is like the prince of the clouds,
Haunting the tempest and laughing at the archer;
Exiled on earth amongst the shouting people,
His giant&rsquo;s wings hinder him from walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left:75px;">Walking around, above, below, </span>
<span style="margin-left:125px;">In between these erected mountains,</span>
<span style="margin-left:30px;">My blissful melancholy swayed by the setting sun.</span></p>
