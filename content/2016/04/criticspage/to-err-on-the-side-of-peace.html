<div style="margin-left:60px;"><p>
What was dead has fallen. What was light, lifted wing.
In the end, oiled birds stippled slinky shore indecent.<br/>
In the beginning, Tiger Beetles, Salmonflies, imago, hailed well, yet&nbsp;&nbsp;
we fell under&#151;Sunline, stray thunderstorms, roiled, crestfallen&#151;
trailed, tailed, shadowed, skulked fossil wakes&#151;unease a slumber.<br/>
In the belly of tomorrow, we pulled the world into herself.
Naissance slept imperiled, still.&#8195;Still sleeps.<br/>
There was more to breaking surface than facing strike, wake.
Frantic pitch, surrender, a million eels, solar flared, in radiant muse,
shallows slipped so distant we pleaded with Gar, bargained
mercy over misery, <em>what was lake remain, what sea recede&#151; </em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we sang here.</p>
