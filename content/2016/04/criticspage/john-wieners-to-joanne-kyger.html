Also some plastic over records. Some guy left me 8000 dollars. Will you write me? i am dying of hunger for you. See your poems everywhere. And Nemi Frost. Do you have her address. i will see you Summer of 1971, on my way to China. Shall i send new poems to Tom Clark for The Paris Review. bob Dylan is singing, &ldquo;For Tonight i&rsquo;ll be Staying Here with You.&rdquo; <br>
