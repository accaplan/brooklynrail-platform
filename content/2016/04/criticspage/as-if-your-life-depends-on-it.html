title: as if your  life depends on it

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:50px;">
<em>stop: freeze: write </em>: what poem do you compose
with a gun to your head? would it click and smoke?
expose your brain&rsquo;s dark matter? what poem do you write
handcuffed to the table? what spirit can a pen release
in a state of unfreed-um? it&rsquo;s gloomy enough
this neptune february for ink to be redundant. backwash.
retread. systole, cramp : clenched, contorted. field
holler as arrest(ed) development.</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px;">
upon closer inspection, the pretty purple lights scatter
into blue and red: the color of your blood, before and after
the lights spot you. run, spot, run. blue blood bleed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:100px;">
i can&rsquo;t for the life of me write like a target. dead
center. dead right. what&rsquo;s left, but the <em>we </em>of the storm? let the ink
bleed. we will holler until we&rsquo;ve fielded all questions. we will spit 
until we&rsquo;ve cleared our throats of stutters. we will scribble until we 
teach the gun wielders to read our righting.</p>
