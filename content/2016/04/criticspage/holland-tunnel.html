<p style="margin-left:100px;">
Somewhere there is a hole
waiting for you<br/>
to put yourself into it&#151;
hand over the fat of you<br/>
(gently, slowly)
into its dark center<br/>
until you are a single raw
rod, an inner finger<br/>
pointing at a tree you spotted
on the road and think you like.<br/>
On the screen that still
somehow holds to magic<br/>
an elegant starlet approaches 
along a terrifying curve. <br/>
Microbes return minerals 
to the soil<br/>
as you walk to the mall 
to abandon your edges.<br/>
Sometimes and all the time
you are shut out of days.<br/>
You pull the single hair 
out of your mouth to achieve sound.<br/>
You lose the language necessary 
to corrupt a field. And beyond <br/>
the factory, what little you have left 
spirals into a self-lubricating dawn.<br/>
The nearly-spoken root 
sucks up some more water. <br/>
The men are vicious pupils 
who open and close your springtime.<br/> 
Little buds everywhere. <em>I don&rsquo;t get</em>
<em>it</em> you say, <em>I don&rsquo;t get it</em> <em>at all</em>.<br/> 
You ask a sudden recognition
on the fox-colored sofa <br/>
as signals come out 
from their dens to arouse you.<br/>
You emerge clean, a convinced ball
no claims / no devices.<br/>
The room maneuvers and becomes
large. You lean towards the mirror<br/>
for hours, manipulating
tiny gardens in your face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
