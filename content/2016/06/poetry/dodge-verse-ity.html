  Dodge-Verse-ity, New Jersey: The Festival at the Heart of the Foundations  A
  Yelp Poem

<p>
&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, 2015 was an historical year for poetry. It marked the dramatic flowering of the most significant development in contemporary poetry in a century: the emergence of women and poets of color as the central drivers of innovation in the art&#133;. [Poetry] collections emerged at a time when daring, original, experimental work that bravely addressed contemporary culture was also written by [women and poets of color]. The current state of contemporary poetry in America&#133;is as vital, diverse and exciting as our population [of women and poets of color]&rdquo; </p>

each move I make you know the counterweight 
  if I dodge left I find you on my right

For Martin Niem&Ouml;ller </p>

(&ldquo;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out&#151; Because I was not a Socialist. 
  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out&#151; Because I was not a Trade Unionist. 
  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out&#151; Because I was not a Jew. 
  Then they came for me&#151;and there was no one left to speak for me. </p>

<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
First, for a lark, they came for the Short Amiris 
  and I did not speak out 
  because I was not a Lark or a Short Amiri</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
de-laureled out of Jersey
  after he blew up America&rsquo;s sacred cow
  then dodged by the very Dodgers who invited him
  to their Rockefeller&rsquo;s dog and pony show 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Then they Dodged &nbsp; 
  the Elderly Jackie 
  Hirschman and Jos&eacute; Kozer </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
and we could not stand and speak out </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
as we were not one of those elderly dozers 
  and loved only the Giants 
  who the Jersey Dodgers 
  refused </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
to play ball </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
with </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
like the Pink O Teethy 
  Tzimtzumian Hirschman &nbsp; 
  or the wine-dark Yiddishy-
  Cuban Kozer...
  Who, refusing exposure
  Inside the prison of identity
  &nbsp;said,
  &ldquo;Me, Japanese!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
No room in the burrows of Dodge-Verse-ity
  To refuse identity 
  for aged poets from the Bronx and Queens 
  for their gods of contractions 
  and tabula rasas 
  here today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone tomorrow 
  for their Tzimtzumian or animistic 
  dirty dancing 
  or Madonna&rsquo;s&nbsp;Q&rsquo;abala 
  with orgasmic consequences 
  of course&#151;like 
  they shoot not so well hung horses don&rsquo;t </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
they
  in Dodge 
  yes they did 
  their due diligence </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
but still </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
somebody there screwed up 
  America&rsquo;s understanding of poetry
  by turning America&rsquo;s 
  elder poets&rsquo; heads </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
far away from Dodge-Verse-ity 
  either not to be seen or 
  made to look bloated and obscene
  like blow-up dolls from Ely Lilly
  who fattened them on Zyprexa
  &nbsp;to treat their dementia
  and then offered the money&nbsp; 
  to the Foundations for&nbsp; Poetry 
  who then came ho ho ho
  &rsquo;ing</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
for me and Julio </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
bringin&rsquo; it down 
  by the schoolyard </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
pickin&rsquo; us up &nbsp; 
  to play</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
the Dodge-Verse-ity 
  card 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  but there was no one left to speak for us </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
So we said &ldquo;Of course, of course 
  a horse is a horse
  drive us to Jersey 
  we&rsquo;ll be 
  your ad-verse-ity 
  Dodge-Verse-ity 
  <em>narco-corrido</em> bards&rdquo; 
  although it was true enough we did not 
  speak out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
from within 
  the experience 
  of </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
&nbsp;Being</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
a lark, a card 
  in the hands of 
  those who claimed to be experimentally AND diversely AND Bravely Original 
  Acrobatic 
  Beings
  Martins of Dodge-Verse-ity </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
who said 
  they had it covered </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
but still 
  were averse to facing poems of the elderly the sickly the unprettily 
  and so cowered </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
to save face 
  and so came 
  with a Seltzer 
  a peace-offering,&nbsp; a place-holder 
  for one Jew-bracing 
  Western 
  David Meltzer </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
&ldquo;come to Dodge please be bop de beep for us&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
but it was too late 
  he refused 
  as the dust </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
had already &nbsp;kicked up </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
in the east 
  like Passover yeast 
  yes be bop 
  de beep 
  they were all asleep 
  and dreaming secretly whispered to each other
  &ldquo;Radical Jew poets in the West look as anachronistic to East coast Dodge Poetry Forums 
  Or Secular Poetix Stock Firms
  (Say Mueller, Moritz and Bernstein)
  as Yiddish speaking Indian chiefs who fall off their horses backwards and go missing&rdquo;
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Watch out for Christ&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Judas 
  &ldquo;Just Stay out of Dodge, Jackie and Benny </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
Just&nbsp;be the emirs 
  of the sickly and unprettily and 
  don&rsquo;t bother us with your Service Cows</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
FAREWELL, fare thee well&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
What, we asked, when they claimed to be experimentally 
  and diversely and bravely original in&nbsp; Dodge-Verse-ity
  in Poetry what 
  could they possibly have 
  against these poets 
  and why 
  did they ne&rsquo;er invite the elderly and the sickly- 
  looking 
  skewed-eyed (lineage of) 
  Duncans and Creeleys and over-bulked Olsons 
  the eco-friendly shut-in Lorine Niedeckers
  the stroked out commie-muraled Muriel Rukeysers 
  breathing a voice-less miner&rsquo;s dust on poetry&rsquo;s pleasers
  who really only feared its &ldquo;total response&rdquo; coming near them 
  or the equally stroked out smokin&rsquo; Jimmie Durham 
  who said &ldquo;I may have a shot on the West Bank, in Palesteen./</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
I&rsquo;ll dance in Beirut. Then West!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
but never among the boys and girls of America&rsquo;s Dodge-Verse-ity </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
who lost his wolf clan Cherokees in</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
&ldquo;the Greek section of Queens&rdquo;</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
Why did those eastern Dodge-Verse-ity boys and girls 
  doubt and deny these names and their poetry 
  the can-do cancerous jazz jaw breaking Panamanian Thomases
  the horse-faced Lorenzos
  and Pancrea--TiTic Bennies and Kearneys
  with their rebuilt hearts and coldly rigored hands
  laid out on gurneys
  or the prostate C. 
  Willie&rsquo;s 
  asking</p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
Why 
  did the whitest ethnic bean 
  counters 
  always wait for someone else to be- 
  come authentic </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
and come prized </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
before inviting 
  anyone but the cow-faced and the pancrea-titic 
  whose poems they couldn&rsquo;t </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
hear or bear to look at 
  like the cooked out Limas and di Primas 
  once lover of the Short Amiri&rsquo;s </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
what could this team of&nbsp;Jersey Dodgers possibly have against these 
  great poets well it could only be
  of course, they shoot not so well hung horses don&rsquo;t they 
  in Dodge </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
why, yes, Rex said 
  it, &ldquo;by g=d I think I&rsquo;ve goT-iT&rsquo;s,&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
their sickly ness es
  no mistaking it
  it&rsquo;s the trans sickly ness es </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
of those poets America&rsquo;s Dodge-Vers-ity could not bear to look at </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
who would be catcalled on&nbsp; stage 
  because their faces and their poems looked like bloated sad cattle 
  or not so well hung horses 
  and thus could never have access to the houses 
  where they crown poets 
  in 
  Dodge-Verse-ity 
  Who </p>
<p style="line-height:2.5em;margin-top:2em;font-size:10pt;">
were averse to the
  diversity of the Dornian gunslingers 
  the sickly the elderly the just plain dung ugly
  Being 
  any 
  where 
  near 
  (Pray, Lord, they are nearing) 
  the Publishers Clearing House 
  of 
  Poetry </p>
