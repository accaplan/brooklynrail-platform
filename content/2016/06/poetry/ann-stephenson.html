The seventh branch reached the third floor
  and flowered outside my window
  did I notice?
  the glass was dirty 
  or I had a lazy eye&nbsp; 
  but with a flush of cheek it changed
  try not to get near it with words
  were you on the S.I. ferry going home?
  it&rsquo;s Saturday but the assholes 
  can&rsquo;t take my apartment away from me
  can they?
  the city runs backwards
  the rivers are zeros the trees are ones 
  the corner hibiscus in full bloom
  ready for romance
  I&rsquo;d like some
  anything running counter to the plan
  have you disembarked yet?
  are you flashing your horn?
  picking a fight discussing food
  with someone who reminds you of your grandmother
  Rita? </p>

It&rsquo;s fun isn&rsquo;t it
  the sporting game of wanting&nbsp; 
  leaving followed by heavy rain 
  I give it up to you
  set my watch by you
  organize myself despite you, dear solstice
  I need 30 more tabs from the pharmacy 
  to get to the end of the month
  released without the typical consternation 
  let there be no phone calls
  no pacing around a room full of crutches
  oatmeal stuck to the ribs
  I need bread I can work with
  really build around
  so my nail beds will behave
  and I can finally get the treatment
  added to the list, embroidered
  they're ready for me
  everything rustles
  then the trail goes dead
  trying to make sense 
  of the signatures
  pointing at me</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

My friendships told their stories
  Two weeks later I'm interested 
  In what will&nbsp;kill us&nbsp;
  Later as in I&rsquo;ll see you later
  Or the hurricane will happen later
  Or not enough sleep was to blame
  Why do I think that everything will be explained&nbsp;
  By someone I run into on the street?
  No one needs to know how these things end 
  Or to what purpose
  On with the program
  Kevin wants to show off his woodworking skills
  I dreamt I was listening from up above the rafters
  Because I was sleeping there
  Among the new angles
  New ideas popped up and caught on
  I thanked everyone for coming to the dream
  For sticking around 
  Also your life will be over soon
  Is that good or bad news?
  Not sure where to go with it
  Why can&rsquo;t we just breathe
  Instead we choke, but on what?
  Water, air, salt, sky
  Creating case histories for the survivors&nbsp;
  Sooner or later a flood will come 
  But now we know what to do with it
  Syphon, push broom</p>

November</p>

Pink smoke
  the single light source
  waiting for you to pass
  toxic but beautiful 
  parts of the afternoon&rsquo;s crazy-making appear &nbsp;
  next to you
  caught in the act 
  of enjoying yourself
  confess your top secret love 
  you're tired
  but come on, the cold hasn&rsquo;t hit yet
  and the world will never run out of flowers
  and paintings of flowers
  did you know there's another river under this one
  and it&rsquo;s not the subway?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

That&rsquo;s enough
  Little delays in my transistor 
  Not sure what to think 
  Hummed opportunity
  Back of the throat
  At dusk my curly-haired friend met me
  In the walk-in
  We shelled beans
  I fell down in the cooler
  Hurting my knee
  Those stairs lead to a mountaintop
  No more facts
  This set paper makes the moon look cheap
  My queen
  I wanted the moon
  I ordered it framed it hung it
  I say one thing and do another
  I'm bad at being good 
  Hold all my calls 
  Better to let them know 
  You&rsquo;re ignoring them
  Their remedies hurt my ulcer 
  I regard this meal as an abuse of nightshades
  Once Brigitte tried to sell Joan Jett leather pants
  Joan didn&rsquo;t want to hear it
  I felt B&rsquo;s frustration
  Like when Lori waited in a car
  For Stevie Nicks to arrive at a hair salon
  In a floral print dress
  Lori scared her with her cassette tape
  Lawyers were mentioned
  I&rsquo;m always relieved when my phone lights up
  Not with people
  But the word of the day
  Today it&rsquo;s <em>dissilient</em>
  Yesterday was <em>anfractuous</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

What other flowers shall I love today 
  before logic defies me
  I stomp on past the deli
  I know myself well and can guess
  the outcome after several tries
  why is everyone in shorts today?
  they&rsquo;re impatient, they&rsquo;re freezing
  I&rsquo;m telling the truth aren&rsquo;t I?
  it&rsquo;s dreadful that the drugs in our building
  must be escorted into the same apartment
  by many hands, I can't keep count 
  truth telling persists
  third juice of the day, fifth coffee, first lemon, second banana
  wonderful your being here with me
  we have a rabbit in the back garden</p>
