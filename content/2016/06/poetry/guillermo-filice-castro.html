Dorothy and the Wiz Part Two </p><br/>
<p>
Back where we used to be, darling.</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s the same lot only the wrong scene, still shot </p>
<p>
In ancient Technicolor stock.</p>
<p>
As always you smell of raw animal and soap.</p>
<p>
If I were to float above pop star flames as I did long ago</p>
<p>
It would not faze you.</p>
<p>
Why revisit past tricks?</p>
<p>
You always looked wicked in drag, whereas I, out of it,</p>
<p>
Really show my age. And you belt</p>
<p>
Better lies into a microphone or by text. I say, </p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s leave as we came, each unaccompanied</p>
<p>
This time, nakedly proud and feral</p>
<p>
Through shadows bending softly as pubic hair</p>
<p>
On a lion&rsquo;s crotch. Everybody&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>
With the twisters. Blame it on climate change.</p>
<p>
And as I gain altitude and look down on</p>
<p>
The now ripped up road,</p>
<p>
Those words that set you apart, those tones flying </p>
<p>
From your mouth once again</p>
<p>
In the sepia key of C major</p>
<p>
Won&rsquo;t reach me: The heart I gave left me heartless.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Famous Beehive</p><br/>
<p>
<em>x</em></p>
<p>
Hell is Camden with the paparazzi outside your house being rained on. They love shoeless you. They hope for ill-behaved you and they get it: You push back; throw a punch or two. Flashes bite your back again as you forever fall into an ambulance&rsquo;s maw. </p>
<p><em>o</em></p>
<p>
Nothing as full-bodied as the air you give up and we call song. </p>
<p><em>x</em></p>
<p>
Come back, I want to yell, throat agleam. How do you talk to the end of the world? Come into mine instead, shimmering, my cobblestoned fantasy that counts you as a muse; where I&rsquo;ve built a Mus&eacute;e D&rsquo;Orsay while the splendor of the city climaxes out of one famous tower nightly. </p>
<p>
<em>o</em></p>
<p>
Might I break into the screen and pull you out with that smile you reserve for the microphone. Freeze you, pause you: Younger you minus the beehive, minus the wreck your glowing pipes brought. Before you said, <em>I&rsquo;m nothing without my hair.</em></p>
<p>
<em>xoxo</em></p>
<p>
When you were tinny and quivery,
  a third of a note.</p>
<p>
Little clicks and gasps,
  caught between sustain </p>
<p>
and infinite sustain. </p>
<p>
When you were still
  sort of</p>
<p>
happily primitive.
  When the curtain in your kitchen</p>
<p>
bulged out and deflated,
  unable to hold its own gut</p>
<p>
without a body.</p>
<p>
And without a body 
  you, sweetie:</p>
<p>
a keen whisper,</p>
<p>
somewhat innocent 
  of today&rsquo;s clouds</p>
<p>
as they grumble
  thick and just
  tormented</p>
<p>
and so ravishing for that.</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s get it out of the way; this is 
about life, too. </p>
<p>
This is about you.</p>
<p>
You, prolonged; you, not breathing 
on your own, machine assisted. I&rsquo;m 
holding you from across the 
continent. </p>
<p>
This is for you.</p>
<p>
I am writing. In one sitting, no 
bathroom break allowed.</p>
<p>
You are also in the emails I erased 
by accident. You, </p>
<p>
and the last time I saw you a few 
years ago; I cut the visit short. I 
erased you on that day, too.</p>
<p>
Why?</p>
<p>
Face it, darling, you were not exactly 
easy. (<em>And who is? </em>you&rsquo;d say and 
have a chuckle.)</p>
<p>
We love to make our dead laugh.</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m wishing you awake; had I been 
at your bedside</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;d have synced our breathing.</p>
<p>
Still flesh </p>
<p>
falls.</p>
<p>
Housed in your head is that desert. 
How could you plot your own 
escape?</p>
<p>
You have seen meteors spew their 
fulminous messages across the brain-
sky.</p>
<p>
You have breathed invisible 
accidents. You&rsquo;ve fallen</p>
<p>
like milk from above.</p>
<p>
I loved you once, didn&rsquo;t I, former 
crush? </p>
<p>
Spilled then spoiled. </p>
<p>
The dead laugh in their high chairs, 
children that they are.</p>
<p>
Take a last, dazzling breath. Fly.</p>
<p>
May the ground gently let go 
  of your </p>
<p style="margin-left:150px;">
big toe.</p>
