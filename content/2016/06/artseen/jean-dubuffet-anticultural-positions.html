Primordial tenants stand proudly in front of
Their <em>Apartment Houses </em>[in]<em> Paris</em> after the war&#151;
Some on terraces or in frames of doors.
Others transpose their <em>Rustic Dialogue</em> onto
A gesture of <em>Farewell from the Window</em>.
Troweling earth&rsquo;s substances onto one surface,
Scraped away, the incisive lines conform to imagery
That is urgently born, escapes from the artist&rsquo;s inner mind.</p>
<p align="center">
Like a cave painter drawn to memorialize
A hunting ritual at day&rsquo;s transition to night, the light here is generated
From within. A brownish grey palette welcomes
Storms of neighboring colors: green, red, blue,
Fleshy earth, soft and amorphous lumps,
Hide glue, zinc oxide, hues all returned to
The random naturalization of pebbles and sand.
The colors seem to gather together the <em>Will to Power</em>.
(A dictator&rsquo;s image, nude with eyes crazed and a feeble appearance).</p>
<p align="center">
A <em>Jump Rope Dancer</em>, statically frozen in the center below,
Her delineated black outlines were there
To etch the image indefinitely onto our memory.
Glimpses behind a building between intervals of
<em>Four Women Lifting their Arms</em> do not guarantee an 
Immediate entrance. Be patient!</p>
<p align="center">
Meanwhile, a profile of a man on a brooch
(On a woman&rsquo;s stole) and
A wristwatch, handbag, and signature scratched beneath her skirt.</p>
<p align="center">
<em>Black Beauty </em>was painted in
November 1945, liberated from the fear and despair!
The gravity and grace of <em>Jo&euml; Bousquet in Bed</em> since 1918.</p>
<p align="center">
Blotting, pressing, dripping, sliding, broodingly cheerful.
How delightful to meet a person with a <em>Combat Beard</em> or
A woman with <em>Cherry Cheeks,</em> the distant cousin of
A woman with a <em>Growth on the Cheek</em>.
Mir&oacute;, Giacometti, de Kooning may have met them too.</p>
<p align="center">
Someone nearby remarks of her encounter with
<em>Lively Garden</em> and<em> The Cross-Eyed Man</em> that she was astonished
By how brutally reaffirming
The artist&rsquo;s willingness is to use a delicate touch
As part of his arsenal (when needed).
<em>The Beach at Cassis, </em>inversely, is an emphatic masterpiece.
<em>Our Old Land</em>, <em>The Gallant Pursuit</em>,
<em>Texturologie I</em>, and <em>Gray Pavement</em> declare a brand
New world of textural constellation that has always been there.
The fertility of earth
Constantly feeds the mystery of consciousness.</p>
