<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</p>
<p>
This is a poem about Lee Lozano
  (1930-1999), 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her art-
  life life art, at once swan song and
  owl's perspicacious eye, ruler
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wisely cold
  concerning you (false troubadour),
  raucous yet discrete in turn, who
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without prose</p>
<p>
nor rhyme sound, was foundational,
  how nothing else can now be done.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despotically read,
  the mystery of what Lozano might
  have declared her self, her art, towards
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her death,
  speaking under shade of a lime tree
  somewhere in Dallas, Texas, to a
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close friend,</p>
<p>
will never be known. Just like her
  hours of conversation, what she called
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Dialogue Piece</em>
  (1969), when artists came to her SoHo loft,
  all things available, instantaneous, yet
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of talk
  no record can be found beyond someone
  else's art action, someone's memory
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of her,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or like a medieval panegyric 
  on the Spanish queen's favorite bookkeeper
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the numbers
  &#151;account of acres, gold, slippers and sovereign,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the poet, are all today
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one piece&#151;
  gone to most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (elegant superlative
  painted bodies purchased for what had been
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wisdom, future</p>
<p>
lessons that should have been remembered,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lip glossing over details that once
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enriched poetry
  while they ravaged ramparts and cities&#133;),
  whereas in this instance the numbers leap,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dance &#151;thrash,
  grand jet&eacute;; clinamen of cause/effect&#151;
  brush back and forth and wander a
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York</p>
<p>
no longer imagined merely as decline),
  this too concurrent with a definition
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of tragedy,
  what philosophers tell in stories about their friends: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfunctory, equivocal praise,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conditional, hidden
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the bidding of a
  brutal era more the subject than any
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one person.</p>
<p>
That is, as Lozano would have her milkshake
  dissipate in flavor of the way presence
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expressed blenders,
  her presence on the scene so integral to
  her absence from official twisty-straws
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of dissemination,
  ostensibly writing about one subject
  while keeping tabs (whole windows) open
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on another </p>
<p>
the way someone once taught you
  to savor a near distance when
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walking through
  Manhattan, never making eye contact
  with strangers (one questions whether this is
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; really necessary,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or if it wasn't brought
  from another metropolis),
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so too</p>
<p>
it might have been better not to speak
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sincerely of passion
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when leaving
  Neuk&ouml;lln, queasy with a terminal kiss,
  queasy on the train to the airport,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; queasy with
  your first and only Europe, all your savings
  sucked up in a poorly programmed trip,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; average milkshake.</p>
<p>
Sure, it was magical, though inevitably
  you rule yourself out, believe the
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Western
  so wholeheartedly there's no room left;
  heartbroken cities medieval take a nap,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepwalk through
  mocking castles down to war upon the
  salable fantasy, sleep cessation concrete map,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultish Bermuda</p>
<p>
shorts dreamboating in shoes matched
  to this tourism racket, old world singers with
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new media
  performing culture for a bot on three weeks vacation,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shibboleth spills wine on itself
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as ignorance
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of what is understood to be culture
  frustratedly puked into anxious wake of
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two years</p>
<p>
gone by, always larger in thought than what was there;
  thus it would have been you could free yourself had you
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen yourself
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reunited with a ghost,
  remembered laughing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had known Lozano's 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;MAGIC WORD
  TO CANCEL SPELLS [&#133;] OR, TO COUNTERACT A
  WITCH'S POWER;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YELL: ORTHOGRAPHY!&rdquo;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people</p>
<p>
are just a couple red lights atop each tower
  in polyrhythm who agree to alert
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planes flying
  low, a favorite bridge (Verrazano,
  Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queensboro, etc.)
  doesn't really matter, remembering
  many years ago your walk to it,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determined jumper</p>
<p>
barely derailed by the detour, cold beer
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if to die it might be better
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drunk); decide 
  to find a Sp&auml;tkauf, buy a liter of sameness,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this one memory even
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fuzz uncapped
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over the Spree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another glass
  little more than stopped here because
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because freewheel</p>
<p>
separated from the cassette on this
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borrowed bike, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rubber jam
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against frame,
  staring into river's lap, feeling that you
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; failed to fix your heart;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attempted repair
  of one bike, then another, vacation
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occupied, tinkering, pull
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the chain</p>
<p>
pretending it is the cord for some steam engine's
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; horn to disperse cattle who wandered
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#151;calm, sate&#151;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onto the tracks, to fill an open
  seemingly fertile midwestern pasture with
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; antique whistle,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flute of cyclopean&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idiot
  passion misplaced in cycles of work and
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; temporary liberation,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounding less and less like
  announcement, just the mere shriek that follows
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; failed endeavors,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background noise brought
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward by turning up the
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squelch circuit,
  art of sampling reduced to minimal
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beats that back
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talksong complaints</p>
<p>
of exploited subjects: you tried to be present.
  Taking pictures all day long, for the first time
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you note
  suspension cables, lights evenly spaced
  along mainstays&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#151;the deck's yellow
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; streetlamps plucked
  as periodically obscured by cables
  from this angle walking toward the
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slurred mass</p>
<p>
they are points that define the arc&#151;
  parabola cutaway from a cone,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cone
  emerging from the river's chop and foam
  &#151;invisible, tilted, vertex upheld in the sky, pointing
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond bridge
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to an unscalable focus,
  inhuman aperture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traced in human feats,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in parabolas</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across the suspension of puns
  that stretch and pierce and haunt every
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form imagined
  until the roving, perforated geometries
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become so unbearably diaphanous
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to possess
  and dispel the line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you pinch yourself,
  construct a cone of skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; architectural feat
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centered in</p>
<p>
Grunewald, where today the two of you walk,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long ago the site of a battle,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke weed,
  stand on the cliffside overlooking Havel,
  sloops in the sunset, jibs described as vermillion
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you feel
  confused about because they were previously red,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and whenever you read it aloud
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sound</p>
<p>
of this word (vermillion) reminds you of <em>verde</em>,
  so you think of a pine green, forest green,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undeniably green,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though the word means red-orange;
  thus departing from a plainer sense
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (red), you're
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcome by its opposite (green),
  flash of words a hole in the fabric of their
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; canvas sails</p>
<p>
fluttering through the mind as potential
  paintings never completed, as Lozano's
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Wave Paintings'</em> 
  (1969) undulant lines a mimicry
  of what was to come&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (wave wave wave goodbye)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#151;rhythmic knowing
  herself, hours carefully haptic&#151; were a straight
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shot through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vibration, stoned
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for days,</p>
<p>
sped-up on bennies to finish in one sitting
  magnified nanometers of color &#151;one red,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two green,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next one gone, stoned again&#151;
  stoned every day in protest of mastery,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abstraction rejected,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her own work suddenly gauche,
  ruled herself out, cut holes in the canvas
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lost now,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrown on the streets of SoHo,
  draped sprawl of history, like swimming
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;upside down,
  quicksilver surface to look through
  to better understand the purpose of
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this visit,
  like looking through the infinite yet
  countable latticework of a medieval
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden wall</p>
<p>
where you can see yourself, or someone else
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who thinks he is in love,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sees people
  fuck in the shapes and shadows,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limbs and torsos reorganize,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hair flows,
  unsure what is or where because he never
  watched other people fuck in
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; real life</p>
<p>
(only on digital screens), adjusting
  his position to better view them
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through this
  perforated canvas,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poke a finger
  to clear a leaf and realize, due to your
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shifting line
  of sight, that there is a second screen
  beyond the first, their vectors producing
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a third</p>
<p>
screen of shapes in magnifying proportions,
  inflating volume, a million samples of
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skin, synced
  moaning and movement, or then steadying
  yourself on the wall with both hands, face
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flat against
  and eye to oculus, out of a single view
  so many moonbeams pour into cold flesh,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quicksilver surface</p>
<p>
the mirror Lozano held between her legs
  to observe an art without supports, what she called
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Masturbation Investigation</em>
  (1969), wherein she records &ldquo;TUMESCENCE, TURGIDITY,
  COLOR CHANGE FROM LIGHT RED TO BRIGHT RED,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VIOLENT EJACULATION
  OF LUBRICATION FROM DUCT NEAR CLITORIS,
  &amp; VIBRATION DURING ORGASM,&rdquo; becoming
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borderless person</p>
<p>
salty origin of all things made public,
  worlding waterfall, fountain of thought that
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never ends
  but is held apart open vulva of all
  material phenomena squirting forth,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song in
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; climax&nbsp; a cosmos
  alluded to throughout the whole tradition of
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human joy</p>
<p>
never caught in a snapshot. Landscape rebuilt
  with bricks and remnants of what stood before
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bombing,
  what is there to find here? What is it
  you think is worth talking about now?
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek
  a herculean empathy, patience and
  forgiveness for all beings&#151; can it be built,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this world,</p>
<p>
this infinite utopian moment, with anyone?
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that love? Or is it
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always impossible
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because you believe things,
  do not recognize fathomless possibility
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within you,
  experience personal history as actions
  you yearn to know yet cannot share,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot recall,</p>
<p>
because of those selfsame experiences&#151; no.
  To wit: you demand to be understood, and in
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that effort
  to understand, admit that you do not,
  do not understand, and lose her
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in laurels.
  She always mixes up the Spanish word for bear,
  (<em>oso</em>) with the word for eye (ojo). How lovely:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eye</p>
<p>
as bear endeared to the thought of pulling
  gestures from a stream, arc of bridge
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cast like
  fishing line to pull back from extinction
  brown bears in Grunewald, evoked with a crack
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#151;short whip
  back to the bridge over the Spree, their absence
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the invisibility of an eye to itself,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>ocio cultural,</em></p>
<p>
arbitrarily consumed, because you don't know
  the difference between Austrian and German
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; culture anyway,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so it doesn't matter
  where the two of you go for dinner
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when Berlin
  is under construction; every museum
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to see
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under construction.</p>
