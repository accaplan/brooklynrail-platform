## The New Social Environment
Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Brooklyn Rail has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

## Speaking

**Peter Brook** (b. 1925, London) has distinguished himself in theater, opera, cinema, and writing throughout his career. He directed his first play in London in 1943 and has since directed more than 70 productions in London, Paris, and New York. His work with the Royal Shakespeare Company includes _Love’s Labour’s Lost_ (1946), _Measure for Measure_ (1950), _Titus Andronicus_ (1955), _King Lear_ (1962), _Marat/Sade_ (1964), _US_ (1966), _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ (1970), and _Antony and Cleopatra_ (1978). In 1971, he founded with Micheline Rozan the International Centre for Theatre Research in Paris and opened its permanent base in the Bouffes du Nord Theatre in 1974, where he has presented works such as _The Iks_ (1975), _Conference of the Birds_ (1979), _The Cherry Orchard_ (1981), _The Tragedy of Carmen_ (1981), and _The Mahabharata_ (1985), and, most recently, _The Suit_ (2012), _The Valley of Astonishment_ (2014) and _Battlefield_ (2015)—many of these in both French and English. Brook’s longstanding relationship to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where many of his productions have been seen in New York, dates back to the 1970s, when BAM presented his innovative rendering of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ with the Royal Shakespeare Company. As part of the 1987 Next Wave Festival, he presented the nine-hour, three-part Indian epic _The Mahabharata_, followed by Chekhov's _The Cherry Orchard_ (1988), _The Man Who_ (1995), _The Tragedy of Hamlet_ (2001), _The Suit_ (2013), and _Battlefield_ (2016). He has directed operas at Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Bouffes du Nord, and the Aix-en-Provence Festival. Brook’s autobiography, _Threads of Time_, was published in 1998 and joins his other titles including _The Empty Space_ (1968), _The Shifting Point_ (1987), _There are no Secrets_ (1993), _Evoking (and Forgetting) Shakespeare_ (1999), and _The Quality of Mercy_ (2014). His films include _Moderato Cantabile_ (1959), _Lord of the Flies_ (1963), _Marat/Sade_ (1967), _Tell me Lies_ (1967), _King Lear_ (1969), _Meetings with Remarkable Men_ (1976), _The Mahabharata_ (1989), and _The Tragedy of Hamlet_ (2002, TV).
