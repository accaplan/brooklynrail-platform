Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**EJ Hauser** is a Brooklyn-based painter. In today's New Social Environment she discusses the significance of text and writing in her art, how she came to incorporate technology into her practice, advice sheâ€™s received from fellow artists Chris Martin and Tamara Gonzales, and beyond.

**Phong Bui** is Publisher and Artistic Director of the _Brooklyn Rail_.
