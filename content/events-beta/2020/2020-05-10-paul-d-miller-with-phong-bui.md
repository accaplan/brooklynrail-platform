Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Chuck Smith** is the filmmaker behind Barbara _Rubin & the Exploding NY Underground_ and _Forrest Bess: Key to the Riddle_.

**Phong Bui** is Publisher and Artistic Director of the _Brooklyn Rail_.
