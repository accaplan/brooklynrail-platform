Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Brooklyn Rail has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Adam Walker:** At the forefront of a new generation of wind soloists, Adam Walker was appointed principal flute of the London Symphony Orchestra in 2009 at the age of 21 and received the Outstanding Young Artist Award at MIDEM Classique in Cannes. In 2010 he won a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Fellowship Award and was shortlisted for the Royal Philharmonic Society Outstanding Young Artist Award.

He performs internationally as a soloist with leading orchestras, and as chamber musician regularly appears at major concert venues and festivals. He is a Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center ‘Bowers programme’ artist.

Adam studied at Chethams School of Music in Manchester, and the Royal Academy of Music in London. He is professor of flute at Londons ‘Royal College of Music’.

**George Grella**  is a musician and writer. His performing experience includes playing jazz, classical and improvised music at CBGB, the original Knitting Factory, and Weill Recital Hall. As a composer, he has produced chamber music, opera, electronic music and has created music for dance and cartoons. He is an important voice in music criticism, serving as music editor at the Brooklyn Rail, critic at the New York Classical Review, and the author of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew, the first jazz title in the 33 1/3 series from Bloomsbury.
