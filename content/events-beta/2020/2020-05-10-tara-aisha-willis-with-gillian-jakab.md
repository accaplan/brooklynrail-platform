Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the  _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Tara Aisha Willis**  is a dancer and a PhD candidate in Performance Studies at New York University. She is Associate Curator in Performance & Public Practice at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

Willis has held editorial positions for  _Women & Performance_  and  _TDR/The Drama_  Review, and co-edited with Thomas F. DeFrantz a special issue of  _The Black Scholar_. Other writings appear in  _Movement Research Performance Journal_, the _Brooklyn Rail_,  _Magazin im August_,  _Voices from the Bush_,  _Dancing Platform Praying Grounds: Blackness, Churches_, and _Downtown Dance_,  _Performance_  _Research_, and  _Performa Magazine_. Willis performed in a collaboration between Will Rawls and Claudia Rankine, and recently in works by Kim Brandt, Megan Byrne, and Yanira Castro. She danced in the 2016 "Bessie" award-winning performance by The Skeleton Architecture.

**Gillian Jakab**  is the Dance editor at the _Brooklyn Rail_, and an assistant editor at _Gagosian Quarterly_. Her writing focuses on the intersection of dance with just about anything else.
