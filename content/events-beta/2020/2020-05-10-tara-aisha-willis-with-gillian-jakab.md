Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Erica Hunt**  (she/her) is a poet, an essayist, and an educator. She is the author of several collections of poetry including Local History, Piece Logic, and Time Slips Right Before Your Eyes, as well as a collaborative text with artist, Alison Saar, called Arcade. She has taught at Brown University, Wesleyan University, and University of Pennsylvania, among others.

**Charles Bernstein** is a poet and a scholar. His most recent book is _Near/Miss_, from the University of Chicago Press.
