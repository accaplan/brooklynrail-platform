Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Candida Alvarez** is a Puerto Rican artist and educator from Brooklyn, NY. Her current show, Estoy Bien, is at Monique Meloche Gallery in Chicago.

**Terry R. Myers**  is a critic and independent curator based in Los Angeles, and an Editor-at-Large at the _Rail_.
