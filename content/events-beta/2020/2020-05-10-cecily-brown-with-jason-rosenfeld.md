Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the  _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Cecily Brown** is a painter, born in London who lives and works in New York.

**Jason Rosenfeld** is Distinguished Chair and Professor of Art History at Marymount Manhattan College. He was co-curator of the exhibitions _John Everett Millais_ (Tate Britain, Van Gogh Museum), _Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde_ (Tate Britain and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), and _River Crossings_ (Olana and Cedar Grove, Hudson and Catskill, New York). He is a Senior Writer and Editor-at-Large for the _Brooklyn Rail._
