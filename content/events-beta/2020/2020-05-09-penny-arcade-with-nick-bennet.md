Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Brooklyn Rail has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Penny Arcade**  is an internationally respected performance artist, writer, poet and experimental theatre maker known for her magnetic stage presence, her take no prisoners wit and her content rich plays and one liners. She is the author of ten scripted performance plays and hundreds of performance art pieces. Her work has always focused on the other and the outsider, giving voice to those marginalized by society. Her willingness to speak truth to power at the expense of career concerns has made her an international icon of artistic resistance. Her decades-long focus on the creation of community and inclusion as the goals of performance and her efforts to use performance as a transformative act mark her as a true original in American theatre and performance.
