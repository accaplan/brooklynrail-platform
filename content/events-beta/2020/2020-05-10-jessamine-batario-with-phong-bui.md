Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Jessamine Batario** is an Art Historian who lives in Maine. She is currently the Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby College. Batarioâ€™s research has been supported by fellowships and grants from the Dedalus Foundation (New York), the Getty Research Institute (Los Angeles), the Vivian L. Smith Foundation at The Menil Collection (Houston), and The Graduate School (UT Austin).

 **Phong H. Bui**  is Publisher and Artistic Director of the _Brooklyn Rail_.

**In the _Rail_:**
