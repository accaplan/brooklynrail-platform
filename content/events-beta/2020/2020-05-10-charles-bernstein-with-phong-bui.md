Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Charles Bernstein**'s most recent book is _Near/Miss_, from the University of Chicago Press.

**Phong Bui** is Publisher and Artistic Director of the _Brooklyn Rail_.
