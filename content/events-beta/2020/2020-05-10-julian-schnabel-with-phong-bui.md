Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the current crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Julian Schnabel**  is an artist and filmmaker based in New York, his most recent solo show of paintings, The Patch of Blue the Prisoner Calls the Sky, opened at Pace Gallery in March. His films include  _At Eternityâ€™s Gate_  (2018) and  _Miral_  (2010), among others.
