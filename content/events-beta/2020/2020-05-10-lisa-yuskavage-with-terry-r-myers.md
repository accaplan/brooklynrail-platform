Dearest Readers and Friends,

In response to the imminent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic the _Brooklyn Rail_ has shifted our operations online. Under these new circumstances, we remain dedicated to supporting our community of readers, writers, and artists.

We believe it is more important than ever to engage in alternative modes of social participation.

**Lisa Yuskavage** is an American painter who lives and works in New York.

**Terry R. Myers** is a critic and independent curator based in Los Angeles, and an Editor-at-Large of the _Rail_. From 1990 to 2019 he held faculty positions at Pratt Institute, Otis College of Art and Design, Art Center College of Design, California College of the Arts, the Royal College of Art in London, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
