<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually keep a diary but sometimes I write things down on A4, and I sort of faintly hope they survive,&rdquo; says Sean Scully. &ldquo;I like to write by hand and I like to accompany it with a drawing. It&rsquo;s almost like an illuminated manuscript.&rdquo; Over a nearly fifty-year career, the ritual has accounted for an untold number of illustrated thoughts, many of which have been stored into shoeboxes for safekeeping, though occasionally the custom goes awry. &ldquo;Some perish of course, because they get left in hotels, or whatever.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought of the insets in my paintings as figures, cut in or cut out of their context, their personal landscape. Bodies that linger,&rdquo; reads a survivor of Scully&rsquo;s filing practice, dated August 18, 1989. One of the artist&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;insets&rdquo; is drawn below. Scully embeds paintings, usually striped abstractions, into other striped abstractions, constructing them together so that the resulting work becomes a small architectural marvel as much as it is a painting. &ldquo;I thought of these paintings with insets as being very metaphorical and I thought of the insets as being separate creatures. I sometimes made the body of the painting in one room and the inset in another room so that I wasn&rsquo;t unconsciously looking for harmony. I was looking for a new kind of relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Figures. Bodies that linger. New kinds of relationships. So much of the body, not just the corporeal but the human essential, is intrinsic to the work. &ldquo;In 1980 I thought that conceptual art and abstract painting were in a relationship that was detrimental to abstract painting, because of the amount of territory abstract painting had to cede in order to stay in that relationship. So I thought it was time for a divorce,&rdquo; Scully says, extending the metaphor. &ldquo;I immediately thought about the history of painting, and windows, which give two views in a single painting. Matisse was a great exponent of that, and so were the painters of the Renaissance. So was Vel&aacute;zquez.&rdquo; The initial geometry of Scully&rsquo;s insets&#151;the windows&#151;soon give way to his lush and emotional stripes of color, which sometimes unite and other times do battle with each other. So very human. So much like life. &ldquo;I was attacking the whole concept of planar abstraction and making abstraction figurative, referential, and metaphorical all over again.&rdquo; A lot can be packed <a name="_GoBack"></a>into a scrawled note to oneself.</p>
<p>(And oh, to open the desk drawer of a hotel room somewhere in the world, and uncover one of those long-lost illuminated manuscripts.)</p>
