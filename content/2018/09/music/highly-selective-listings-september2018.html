Legendary percussionist Milford Graves is a New York City avant-garde treasure who revolutionized the art of free-improvisation on seminal records with the New York Art Quartet, Paul Bley, Sonny Sharrock, and his own recordings as leader. He was the subject of a feature-length documentary portrait,&nbsp;<em>Milford Graves Full Mantis</em>, and tonight he joins forces with multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, of Marc Ribot&rsquo;s Ceramic Dog, in what will certainly be an out-of-this-world collaboration. This stellar bill is completed by composer and experimental artist Marina Rosenfeld and improvising vocalist Charmaine Lee, whose&nbsp;<em>Ggggg</em>&nbsp;(via Philip White&rsquo;s Anticausal label) is a warped and entrancing sound-world.</p>

On its fourth record,&nbsp;<em>Lowlands</em>&nbsp;(Nefarious Industries), local all-instrumental prog-metal trio Zevious have jacked up the dizzying complexities and eardrum-busting sonics with their math-iest effort to date. Tech-metal mad scientists Cleric and Krallice&rsquo;s Mick Barr open what is the guitar-note-heaviest event of the year.</p>

Pianist and composer Moran goes beyond the indie-classical label, taking the tools of her trade (which include electronics and prepared piano techniques) and using them as director of Oneohtrix Point Never&rsquo;s live ensemble.

<p><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=140669943/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=large/transparent=true/" width="560" height="315" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>September 16: Red Hook Jazz Festival at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbanmeadowbrooklyn.blogspot.com/">Urban Meadow</a>. Though down to only one day this year, the combination of the line-up and the cost means this is still one of the finest jazz events in and around NYC. In the late summer sunshine, $15 (kids free) gets you two bands from drummer Andrew Drury, mandolinist Snehasish Mozumer &amp; SOM, and Marc Ribot.</p>
<p>September 17: Mary Halvorson/Bill Frisell Duo &amp; Robbie Lee/Mary Halvorson Duo (Double Album Release) at&nbsp;<a href="https://lpr.com/lpr_events/mary-halvorson-bill-frisell-duo-robbie-september-17th-2018/">(le) Poisson Rouge</a>. From&nbsp;<em>Code Girl</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Away With You</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Ours</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Theirs</em>&nbsp;by collaborative trio Thumbscrew, the fretboard-hopping mastery of guitarist Mary Halvorson never ceases to amaze. Her mind-bending guitar work continues on not one, but two new records celebrated tonight. Halvorson will first break out unconventional guitars like a circa&ndash;1899 18-string Knutsen harp guitar, a 1930 Gibson L&ndash;2 guitar, and an 1888 SS Stewart 6-string banjo as she teams with multi-wind player Robbie Lee to loosely recreate the music found on their new rustic duo record,&nbsp;<em>Seed Triangular</em>&nbsp;(New Amsterdam). Then Halvorson and guitar luminary Bill Frisell will pay homage to 1950&rsquo;s jazz guitar pioneer Johnny Smith from their new Tzadik release,&nbsp;<em>The Maid With The Flaxen Hair&ndash; A Tribute To Johnny Smith</em>.</p>
<p>September 19: Dan Weiss&rsquo; Starebaby at&nbsp;<a href="https://lpr.com/lpr_events/dan-weiss-nublu-september-19th-2018/">Nublu</a>. Released earlier this year,&nbsp;<em>Starebaby</em>&nbsp;(Pi Recordings) will surely wind up on year-end best lists in both the jazz and metal categories. Drummer and composer Weiss, with Melvins/Mr. Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn, guitarist Ben Monder, and keyboardists and pianists Matt Mitchell and Craig Taborn, sublimely connected the metal and jazz dots. Part soul-crushing, part head-spinning, and part minimalist electronic composition,&nbsp;<em>Starebaby</em>&nbsp;is a masterwork.</p>

<p>September 20: Jonathan Goldberger/JP Schlegelmilch/Jim Black&nbsp;<em>Visitors</em>&nbsp;Album Release Concert at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/847571595440788/">Nublu</a>. Consisting of heavy-hitters culled from the Brooklyn jazz avant-garde, the trio of guitarist Jonathan Goldberger, keyboardist JP Schlegelmilch, and drummer Jim Black go prog-rock-heavy and spaced-out on&nbsp;<em>Visitors</em>&nbsp;(Skirl Records), a sprawling, otherworldly shred-fest that&rsquo;s like Sun Ra jamming with King Crimson.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3195050059/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=large/transparent=true/" width="560" height="315" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>September 21: Zeal &amp; Ardor at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.musichallofwilliamsburg.com">Music Hall of Williamsburg</a>. Manuel Gagneaux&rsquo;s Zeal &amp; Ardor project began with a racist comment on the internet, and now his first two albums have entirely invented rock by cutting out decades of dead weight and melding the extreme present of metal with the extreme roots of black folk music. His music is violent, impassioned, and darkly beautiful (read John Amen&rsquo;s look at the two Zeal &amp; Ardor albums in our&nbsp;<a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2018/09/music/Zeal-Ardors-Visionary-Diptych">current issue</a>).</p>

<p>September 22: Robert Rich at&nbsp;<a href="http://ambient.church/work/robertrich/?mc_cid=dabb2d78a2&amp;mc_eid=0056390699">Ambient Church</a>. For the Autumn Solstice, Ambient Church brings in one of the great contemporary electronic musicians and composers. Rich&rsquo;s palette ranges from the iciest cold of empty space to an all-suffusing warmth, perhaps evoking memories of autumns past, lost to our current ongoing terraforming project.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTpfZAmtQpA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>September 28: Traden (Trad, Gras och Stenar) and Endless Boogie at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axs.com/events/355882/trad-gras-och-stenar-endless-boogie-tickets?skin=mhow">Music Hall of Williamsburg</a>. Guitar solo heroics and epic jams will be on full display when local scuzzy-blues veterans Endless Boogie and Traden, the Swedish psych-rock legends (formerly known as Trad, Gras och Stenar) touring behind the chilled-out, stoner psychedelia of this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Traden</em>, hit the stage.</p>
<p>September 28: Golden Retriever, Byron Westbrook and LEYA at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/golden-retriever-byron-westbrook-leya-tickets-49140509587">Park Church Co-op</a>. With modular synth and bass clarinet, the Portland-based experimental duo Golden Retriever (Matt Carlson and Jonathan Sielaff) create ecstatic and meditative sound fields teeming with harmonically gorgeous textures and patterns that draw from classical music, minimalism, jazz, and new age, as heard on their most recent record, 2017&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Rotations</em>&nbsp;(Thrill Jockey). Tonight, Golden Retriever make a rare appearance here and the Park Church Co-op will be the perfect setting for their blissful tones, as it will be for the openers, sound artist Byron Westbrook and LEYA, a violin, harp, and voice duo.</p>

After two decades of research, interviews, filming, and fundraising, Tom Surgal&rsquo;s tireless quest to trace and tell the history of free jazz in his exhaustive documentary&nbsp;<em>Fire Music</em>&nbsp;is finally hitting the big screen with extensive interviews, rare footage and photographs, and a focus on giants like Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Sam Rivers, Sun Ra and his Arkestra, and more such titans. On September 29 and October 1, catch Q&amp;A sessions with the filmmaker himself, his wife, and White Out band-mate Lin Culbertson, and famed jazz critic Gary Giddins. Not to be missed.</p>
<p>September 30-October 6:&nbsp;<a href="https://gemsny.org/events/artek">Cafe d&rsquo;ARTEK</a>. From one of New York&rsquo;s oldest and finest early music ensembles comes this concert of madrigals, solos, duets, and trios from early 17th-century composers Michelangelo Rossi and Biagio Marini. Both composers are shining examples of how modern early music still sounds. Presented in a cafe-style setting in two locations, St. Michael&rsquo;s Church in Manhattan and 17 Frost Gallery in Williamsburg.</p>
<p>October 1: Brandon Seabrook Trio:&nbsp;<em>Convulsionaries</em>&nbsp;Album Release at&nbsp;<a href="http://roulette.org/event/brandon-seabrook-trio-convulsionaries-album-release/">Roulette</a>. Notes-crazed guitar freak Brandon Seabrook has cranked out operatic metal with Die Trommel Fatale and math-metal with Needle Driver, and now on his new record he calls&nbsp;<em>Convulsionaries</em>&nbsp;(Astral Spirits), he&rsquo;s mixing up elements of contemporary classical with the ferocity of metal and prog&mdash;all without a drummer. Joined by upright bassist Henry Fraser and cellist Daniel Levin, Seabrook&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Convulsionaries</em>&nbsp;is scorched-earth brilliance that improbably combines Karlheinz Stockhausen, Anthony Braxton, and The Flying Luttenbachers.</p>
