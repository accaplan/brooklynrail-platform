<p>I probably had some common interests with Fabro, although I did not include him in the show I organized at Castelli Warehouse which included Anselmo and Zorio.&nbsp;Even some of my recent work using linen and carbon fiber cast over mannequins and then stripped off, leaving the figure as void, resonates with his prone marble figures. And I like his note of equivalence between same material/different formal manifestation in some of his sculptures. Ah, those heady days of non-art materials when process set the ball rolling and we had air to breathe.&nbsp;Now the market has eaten us all. From this distance the gestures we once made against it seem futile and even puerile. Money is the only value in America. Is Europe any different? The edge of didacticism in some of Fabro's work annoys. Not fair, but a Johns Flag weighs tons compared to a leather Italy. Still, Mussolini hanging upside down &hellip; There was once a kind of diffuse griminess to &rsquo;60s American hands on art that had an affinity with some Art Povera.
