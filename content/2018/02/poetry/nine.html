<br>
<p><em>Fame is not to be yours</em></p>
<p>I suddenly thought like a street tarot reader</p>
<p>pronouncing a destiny to a crowd.</p>
<p>The card is blackened a flattened</p>
<p>leaf on the sidewalk in the shape of a bat. And</p>
<p>a wet Jack of Spades with extravagant blue handwriting.</p>
<p><em>Just to break it down to you</em>, says a man behind me.</p>
<p><em>800 letters </em>he says and just as many stars</p>
<p>flicker invisibly in three inches of the sky</p>
<p>which this late afternoon is thin as skin.</p>
<p>I hover over my own fate</p>
<p>and for two seconds, not more,</p>
<p>am indifferent</p>
<p>though not empty of will.</p>
<p>A flash of the sun.</p>
<p>across one&rsquo;s eye, a golden dust</p>
<p>on a note book page. A swimming</p>
<p>nothing where there is no one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Astroturf</strong></p>
<br>
<p>No one could make a sentence</p>
<p>from a swarm</p>
<p>of glittering buttons in glass.</p>
<p>You see buttons and think bones.</p>
<p>I found a dollar in the grass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presidential head</p>
<p>afloat in rain.</p>
<p>In the space of rhetoric</p>
<p>color is artifice</p>
<p>repellant as Astroturf.</p>
<p>I hear orange chatter.</p>
<p>A head in a room</p>
<p>like a monstrous abalone</p>
<p>with tiny teeth</p>
<p>that clasp their meat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blue Wire</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Stare at a room filled with things.</p>
<p>Each object blurs in the blue blanket of air.</p>
<p>Go to the bathroom and adjust</p>
<p>something.</p>
<p>Wash wool socks in a sink.</p>
<p>Pause at</p>
<p>drips, footsteps and squeaks.</p>
<p>Think: lingonberries, gravitas, meld,</p>
<p>butter knife, echolalia.</p>
<p>Fence, persimmon, caulk</p>
<p>shadow, relent, relay.</p>
<p>And perforate.</p>
<p>Notice a vibration.</p>
<p>A sensation that is named <em>ringing</em></p>
<p>but is more of a whine. Less a calling to.</p>
<p>A spilling.</p>
<p>The tension of a blue wire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Microdots</strong></p>
<p class="quote-attribution"><em>For Toni Simon</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Every day is like a puzzle.</p>
<p>A jumble of microdots</p>
<p>that coalesce</p>
<p>into a multidirectional stairway.</p>
<p>The palm is crossed with an x.</p>
<p>An island they call that. Inside a chain across skin.</p>
<p>A drawbridge reality</p>
<p>is enfolded in a structure that is read</p>
<p>as knotted owl pellets on the road.</p>
<p>Bones and wool, hair and rocks.</p>
<p>The future in a wave.</p>
<p>A folded sea that surfaces inside</p>
<p>squares of fire.</p>
<p>Now I see curtains of contoured plasma</p>
<p>in a shadow&rsquo;s dissembled books</p>
<p>that wait for the hand to write.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blue Window</strong></p>
<br>
<p>A small square blue book</p>
<p>reduces thought to a palm size</p>
<p>and enlarges a speck of it</p>
<p>so that it becomes a window.</p>
<p>A blue window in a wall</p>
<p>as if the eye were a giant</p>
<p>machine and a globular insect</p>
<p>dragging its spiky wings</p>
<p>to any opening</p>
<p>it may surmise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mariage Fr&egrave;res</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Crumbled colored smoke with a violet tint</p>
<p>dead flowers mixed with ash and earth</p>
<p>that you might find if you look under a rock</p>
<p>in the woods in Connecticut, for example.</p>

<p>An initiatory action analogous to</p>
<p>writing a poem with debris and lint.</p>
<p>It forms a darkened cloud</p>
<p>lifts to a surface</p>
<p>and swirls among elements.</p>

<p>You take a sip of the brew</p>
<p>and look everywhere so as to replicate the experience</p>
<p>and to have it contained</p>
<p>in a black book labeled in French.</p>

<p>I know its effects cannot really be configured that way</p>
<p>or any &ldquo;way&rdquo;</p>
<p>but it takes so many years to find that out</p>
<p>and then is realized instantaneously.</p>
<p>First made by two incestuous</p>
<p>brothers from across the sea</p>
<p>baptized Marco Polo</p>
<p>poetry is finite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I meant the exact opposite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In the Underpass</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Today in the underpass</p>
<p>two women asked for a little change</p>
<p>and I said no.</p>
<p>Not today, tightening my jacket</p>
<p>as though to announce: I have my precincts.</p>
<p>Well, God Bless you they said in unison.</p>
<p>And I went on to buy baby kale</p>
<p>and eco toilet paper</p>
<p>and to drink some hot chocolate with cayenne</p>
<p>from Jacques Torres.</p>
<p>Later, I read about the two women grinding at the mill</p>
<p>and better not to return to the fields to get your clothes</p>
<p>that you left there when running away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Capella</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Somewhere down there</p>
<p>On Street number Two or Four or Three</p>
<p>Within its anarchy of stairs and ailanthus leaves</p>
<p>And a folded Persian rug and a wooden book on teas</p>
<p>Popes line up in a path of dusty sheaves</p>
<p>Leading into what or where I cannot quite see</p>
<p>Through the arc of tangled debris.</p>
<p>I remember there was a heretic doyenne among her soliloquies</p>
<p>That shimmered under the antique eaves.</p>
<p>Marcella and Brenda, do you recall we started to freeze</p>
<p>In January&rsquo;s sparkle of East Village air. Where are my keys</p>
<p>I said, like usual something was hidden</p>
<p>In the flux of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Things telescope so that they or it or us or just me</p>
<p>Are distanced at an obtuse angle to the critical view,</p>
<p>Absolutely gone we feel but oh wait not necessarily</p>
<p>I realize much later at different point from the sun diurnally</p>
<p>See the forgotten returned although this</p>
<p>A slight swift Halloween epiphany</p>
<p>Brought evening&rsquo;s autumn star back around fleetingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sidhe</strong></p>
<br>
<p>I know these white gray columns.</p>
<p>Dirty and scarred.</p>
<p>A city of mute bishops.</p>
<p>Columnar ghosts.</p>
<p>The dirt along the train tracks</p>
<p>are where fairies are</p>
<p>that keep company with twittering sparrows</p>
<p>glister beads and cellophane.</p>
<p>A sequence of arches.</p>
<p>An inversion of utterances</p>
<p>so that the word is farther back</p>
<p>instead of a banner on the teeth.</p>
<p>When the train ricochets by</p>
<p>everything divides.</p>
<p>I brought an empty tin of rose</p>
<p>gloss to the mound as requested.</p>
<p>Through the pillars see a maze of tangled red letters.</p>
<p>A black ladder at the back of the echo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
