<p><strong>DONNA&rsquo;S SLEEPING</strong></p>
<br>

<p>Helicopters, fly away<br>
Donna&rsquo;s sleeping
Rumbling trucks
Don&rsquo;t shake the house
Donna&rsquo;s sleeping
Little boys across the yard
go in and eat your dinner
Take the dog with you
Donna&rsquo;s sleeping</p>

<p>And she murmurs in her sleep<br>
and pulls the blankets higher
and higher still
Bad dreams, fall apart and
float away, do not attack
her peaceful sleeping
Nightmares, gallop off to
hell, I am keeping watch
and I will beat you
with a stick</p>

<p>I am old and I&rsquo;ve been tired<br>
but I am standing guard as
Donna&rsquo;s sleeping
I&rsquo;m watching for the first 
blink of a waking eye
A smile or an alarm?  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent thousands of nights<br>
and mornings and noons
watching Donna sleeping
and I have requisitioned a
few thousand more
Let&rsquo;s turn out the light, love
Come, we&rsquo;ll go to sleep</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>END OF THE BUSINESS DAY 1975</strong></p>

<p>I looked in every file and folder<br>
under the fax and behind the
Xerox, I retraced my footsteps
and pawed through the waste 
paper and finally
I found what I&rsquo;d done with this poem</p>

<p>So I folded it in half and then in<br>
quarters and then to the size of
a matchbook
and I put it in my breast
pocket and I gave it a pat
and I turned out the lights
and I locked the door
and I ran for my life</p>

<p><strong>F TRAIN TURNS WITH A SNARL</strong></p>


<p>The F train<br>
once the aristocrat of subways
sung of in splendid poems
of my own composition
has become a mad-eyed
reviled renegade
No longer does it wander
peacefully through the
quiet streets of Her Majesty&#146;s 
Own Borough</p>

<p>Now it sulks for hours<br>
in uncharted alcoves
emerging grudgingly and
gulping in passengers 
only to cover them with
smoke and sneer at them
in darkness and I --</p>

<p>once called by a critic<br>
&ldquo;the poet of the F train and
the F word&rdquo; --
try not to stand too close
to the platform edge
The token booths are empty
so there&rsquo;s no one to
answer a question or a
complaint or a shout for help
Some fucken system</p>

<p><strong>MY BLOOD</strong></p>

<p>My father, who was afraid of my mother&rsquo;s craziness, of her screaming and paranoia, told my sister and me that we had to deal with her, that she was our responsibility because we were <em>blood</em> relations and he wasn&#146;t.  He had merely been married to her for fifty-five years, just passing through.  But he was my blood relative and I carry the inheritance in a dented bucket.</p>

<p>As the technician prepared to take blood from my arm -- four tubes this time &ndash; I said that I envisioned, in a dark sub-basement of the hospital, a huge iron vat of my blood, trembling a bit as though something was trying to break through to the surface.  I could tell she was wondering when to call for help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been scared by the sight of my own blood, swirling in the dentist&rsquo;s spit bowl or soaking through a Band-Aid, but I was stunned the first time I stood up after surgery and blood came pouring from the foot-long opening on my abdomen.  The bad-tempered physician&rsquo;s assistant jumped back.  You almost got my dress, she whined.  But then: glub.  She was drowned &ndash; and the blood flowed through the halls, down the stairs, into the cafeteria.  Blood sandwiches were served.  Hollowed out and neatly folded, I floated back onto the island of hospital corners, waiting for someone else&rsquo;s blood to replenish me.</p>

<p><strong>NAVIGATION</strong></p>

<p>In Soho, we&rsquo;ll stop at Gourmet Garage<br>
Tell me how to get there, you say
But you go there by yourself all the time,
what do you do then?
Oh, I just wander up one street
and down another
until I bump into it</p>
		
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Wandering the forest roads near<br>
East Hampton we reveal a genius for finding
wrong turns that do not lead to highways
street signs or evidence of human habitation
I think we&rsquo;ve seen that tree before
Look, there&rsquo;s Galen&rsquo;s house
right where we left it half an hour ago</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In Santa Cruz, we leave the wooded campus<br>
Turn right, onto the ocean highway, I say
We&rsquo;re headed south, strip malls on the right
beach on the left &ndash; five miles, ten miles
Uh-oh. &nbsp;Wrong ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
