title: The New Goldfish

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t recognize<br>
the new goldfish 
so much as swallow with her eye</p>   

<p>having scanned its contours and found they were the mirror image of some<br> comfortable place in her brain whose own<br>
contours matched</p>

<p>a certain tone<br> 
the precision lining clouds in a world whose</p> 

<p>tone is spoken just that way<br>
and heard as well as that, as red</p>

<p>as red is how she understood her objects<br>
as integral to the world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

























<p>at the end, we were attracted to the borders of our private globes<br>  
horizontal sketches of the shore matched vertical articulations of our
atmosphere from space, and together, flat instructions for a deeper
transcendental plan.</p>

<p>we had some motivation, a common red articulating eyelids<br>
told us so, daybreak the same from everywhere except 
the dawn itself, a dustiness non-predatory beings can&#146;t withstand.</p>

<p>we hurled stones into a well and years later heard them thrown back up<br>
to us for our diversion, from where we source our information
and heard their echo as the distance first surmised.</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">the goldfish<br> 
is best experienced
around a household</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">light or sour thought<br>
the dead can think
to hold concordant</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">spasms in the air<br>
and when they speak
voices fit within</p> 

<p style="padding-left:80px">campaigns meant<br>
to silence them 
and people doubt</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">that others walk <br>
engrossed by fractures
in the closet of what&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">lived or what&rsquo;s rehearsed<br>
vernal nutrients
masked invisibly by</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>














<p style="padding-left:80px">time for safeguard<br>
and gravity relinquishing
its broad domain</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">to this specific<br>
rising snow  
remains secure</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">the law is picture book<br>
revealed by little 
halves emitting glitch</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">and perspiration<br>
on a sentimental 
drive</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">that&rsquo;s how<br>
unlike we are
like vinegar</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


















<p>the rocks were steady, a language of diplomacy<br>
commended for indifference to indifferent shades
and swollen on the day&rsquo;s adjacent continent 
before its prism canceled undergrowth. </p>

<p>what is this new kind of living <em>for</em><br>
pebbles roll across the beach as current sound</p>

<p>was all i wrote, i felt belated writing you behind a wall<br>
of decimals, tide ground smooth, fluid assault 
immersed in throat above the larger palate</p> 


<p style="padding-left:80px">of beach&rsquo;s scale, but not their own.<br>
back then was simple</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">very little was a matter of the weather<br>
and doing nothing was the point</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">of exhalation so<br>
i felt belated writing you 
was all i wrote</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align=justify style="padding-left:315px">life sits in front of her eye like a carrot. especially when she wakes up in the morning to admit it. and to grasp a season full of options in that field is to grasp the generative principle of what may lie outside&#151; someone else, complete with blood.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p style="padding-left:80px">and mother cries<br>
not for a baby</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">but the tantrum<br>
he&rsquo;s become</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">oh beautiful boy<br>
emasculated in a process</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">without notice<br>
now as poem </p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">of the goldfish bowl<br>
its depth prospected</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">however drifting past<br>
further radiance in time</p>

<p style="padding-left:80px">invisible as glass in ice<br>
or simply water </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
