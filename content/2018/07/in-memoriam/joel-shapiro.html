Irving was a dedicated and insightful chronicler of his time, which stretched from the fifties&mdash;he was one of our last links to the heyday of the New York School&mdash;to just last month. He was not theoretical or ideological, and he saw through style and fashion. His response to work was deep and visceral, and he went way out for the art and artists that moved him. He was an essential part of the conversation, and his presence will be sorely missed.
