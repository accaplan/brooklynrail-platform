title: Diasporic Memory
---

<p>People often ask me the difference between being an Iraqi in Sweden versus in the United States. I usually find myself taking a deep breath and sinking into my chair before answering this somewhat mnemonic exercise. When I first became a refugee in Sweden there was a clear before and after picture, but as time passed those binaries started to fade, and memories of a past life were intertwined with present and future lives. When one is uprooted because of war, memories become a sort of lifeline to reconstitute oneself. There is a rebuilding of one&rsquo;s biography in a way. That moment when I landed in Sweden as an illegal refugee marked a rupture in my biography, and the aftermath is something I deal with every day. This is the point that I became a war refugee. That moment created a distinction between my past life and my present, and as I was there in this foreign land the only way I knew how to survive was to erase my past memories and my lived experiences.&nbsp; It was a conscious decision to sweep my otherness under the rug in order to fit in. I underwent a process of assimilation. In any shape or form (socially, linguistically, aesthetically) I made it my mission to become a Swede. I did this to the point where I led myself to believe that I was white. I then went through a phase of rebelling against my &ldquo;Swedishness&rdquo; and asserting that I was in fact an Iraqi, born in Iraq and from Iraq, trying to retrieve memories associated with that locality and with that nationhood. This is a rather common occurrence within Arab refugees in Europe. An example is that of Muslim teenage girls who prior to migrating to Europe didn&rsquo;t wear a hijab yet chose to wear it once they arrived in their host country as a form of assertion. As I grew older, I started questioning these very ideas of a nationalistic memory. Why was it so important to say that I came from that space? As I look back at those ideas I think it was more a form of holding on to something that I had actively chosen to repress. This goes back to the idea of trauma in migrant consciousness and the problematics of belonging, forgetting, and remembering. For me it&rsquo;s not about asserting this nationalistic concept of the collective. It&rsquo;s rather about inscribing these memories and getting them out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I landed in the United States by free will, carrying legitimate papers in my pocket. I chose to come here, and that clearly shaped a different encounter with this country. I find it easier to be <em>me</em> here. Yes, I&rsquo;m seen as this fetishized Arab female who is both exotized for my brownness yet also feared for it. Where are you hiding your weapons? I was once sarcastically asked. Yes for some reason it&rsquo;s easier being here than in Sweden. When I visit Sweden now, I always get an out-of-body sense. It&rsquo;s like I can see myself walking the streets, being watched, being judged for the color of my skin. I am automatically degraded to a second class citizen. A refugee: an <em>invandrare</em> (in Swedish). With that also comes a sense of erasure and a peculiar sense of being a nobody yet being hypervisible via my skin. I think back at that moment when I landed in Sweden very often, and it elicits a sense of a violent ending of sorts and a beginning of a life of displacement that haunts me till this day. And I think that&rsquo;s my fear&mdash;that erasure. In a way I am working against that erasure in a constant effort to remember. And when I remember there is also a form of repair that happens. A healing. A working through of something</p>
