title: from Orlando
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">A species of Disney not yet named, don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s over, Orlando, for I&rsquo;m beginning <br /> to forget why I loved you in the first place, open my world like snuff porn, the weather<br /> on my phone still set to your 84 degrees, I count each degree like a droplet of blood,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">My period tense inside your mouth, begging you to beat me into your beaches,<br /> begging you to stuff me into your white sand, fold me into your masochistic tidal<br /> wave of power sources, fluffy, foaming, forgotten, nothing, I want to be the nothing</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">you make me, I want you to tell me I&rsquo;m nothing, I like it so much, I like it when you <br /> you do that, I don&rsquo;t want to forget what it&rsquo;s like to be the only nothing inside your body<br /> I have looked out the peepholes of each of your nineteen skyscrapers, I have sent</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Chris the selfies we took in the bathroom of Hotel Rosenberg and I only<br /> hear from you in the distilled German language of that musician&rsquo;s texts, the phonemes floating <br /> like fake snow inside a diorama of time itself, shadowboxing the poignant eclipse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">I can see the audience, full of Xanax, full of that narcotic dream moon we discussed<br /> for hours, I can see them all now in the velvet theater, waiting for it, wanting that energy<br /> so much, but never making it theirs, but we did that, we took the fantasy of the body,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">the porn of the body, and we transformed it into our own psychic architecture <br /> as in the Dutch tourists who have filmed The Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which is really called <br /> the Yo Ho A Pirate&rsquo;s Life for Me ride, everything Victorian and frilly, a repressed fantasy awakens</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">YouTube Guy Debord sex toy world, fake orgasms, shaved pussies, pouring and pouring <br /> chlorinated water pouring from the corpse like molten spaces, the crystalline and mechanical turns<br /> of what is no longer human, what can&rsquo;t be human anymore, I begged you to beat me,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Orlando, as I told you my life story, a whole history of trauma unrolled like a scroll<br /> from my blue, frothy mouth, and you replaced my mouth with a black, lace corset,<br /> and I liked it so much that I threw away my flesh like a computer coming into focus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">I&rsquo;m not one of them, Orlando, and never will be, it&rsquo;s so hard to make this feel real, <br /> Like Jean Lafitte, defeated but evil, defeated but mean, defeated but so fucking right<br /> clothed in a pile of Galveston horses and fish, chickens, goats, dogs, bones, shit</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Cher was 43 years old in her &ldquo;If I Could Turn Back Time&rdquo; video, which means she was<br /> five years older than I am now, I watch her in that kind of leotard, thong thing,<br /> I want to know what she smells like, underneath the Disney of her soaking limbs,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">I want to know what she dreams about when her wig is off, when she stares into <br /> the formidable black night, formaldehyde bearing down on her chest like a terrible demon,<br /> suffocating her into tiny bubbling orgasms, cryptic as storm light, suffering<br /> &nbsp;<br /> for the greater good, Cher, the dirty sacrifice, the strange way she speaks in a slow hum,<br /> underneath this body sack, I watched her terrible fantasy unravel <br /> and it was as vacuous as fucking in the family bathroom of an airport, how numb the world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">On August 11, 1977 (one day before I am born) a 4-year-old boy from Dolton, Illinois <br /> drowns in the moat surrounding Cinderella Castle but some lose consciousness, some<br /> die of natural causes, some are just old, some hit their heads and die later, some die</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">of their fantasies, some of their insatiable addictions, some commit suicide, some skim<br /> the waters with their hands even though they are supposed to keep their arms and legs in the boat,<br /> Orlando, I believe that their eyes dilate when they see their small shadows against</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">the Small World they weave their way through, they are a kind of collective eureka, they shriek <br /> a giddy shriek into the phantasmagoria of this trashy arrangement, a spell on each reverberating culture, <br /> lit by electronic candles, the moon happy as a solider, every piece dancing to the gnawing</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">poison of shamrocks, windmills, glowworms Chris said I would even work at Subway with you <br /> and then I realized that while I was falling out of something I was falling into something else at <br /> the same time and that disorientation was the colored diorama of life, and for a minute</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">I felt like hearing Chris&rsquo;s voice, which I have never heard, and you are not Orlando anymore,<br /> but something else, I know this in the way the song changes from English <br /> to Japanese, German to Swedish and while Chris braids the urban sounds of negation,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">all night talking to women, Oh you are Orlando, you are not Orlando, you are Orlando,<br /> I can tell by the way you want to make me jealous, the mimetic hollowing out, I have lost you,<br /> lost the feel of you, the way that wanting you would carry me through this, I have lost it</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Today Ezekiel took a water gun, filled it with bathwater and sprayed me while I was sitting<br /> at my desk composing, and the laptop stopped working and in anger, I slammed it shut,<br /> thereby breaking the screen and when I opened the laptop there was nothing but some</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">geometric shapes, formed like 1977, the year of my birth, so I couldn&rsquo;t retrieve any <br /> files and I had to re-create this piece from scratch, as I had lost everything, and this takes<br /> me even further away from understanding the love I felt for you, Orlando,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Then, I decided that feeling itself is actually always already a replication of feeling, <br /> that feeling is a kind of Frankenstein written by a teenage girl, looking more like a diary,<br /> but not the original diary, the diary re-read by the middle aged woman trying to understand</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">the diary she wrote as a teenager, so instead of desperately trying to get the piece I lost back,<br /> I took a diary off my bookshelf because I felt very certain contained in the diary<br /> would be, not only a way to piece the feelings I had for you back together, but also I was certain</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">you had read at least part of the diary behind my back when I dropped the kids off at their dad&rsquo;s house,<br /> and that in secretly reading the diary, at some moment you found something out about me<br /> you could no longer stand, and that is precisely the moment you fell out of love with me,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">abandoning me to the very diaries and bookshelves of my consciousness, both as a teenage<br /> girl and now as a middle aged woman, so I tried to figure out what I could have done back then,<br /> what confession, what moment of weakness, what apology had driven you out of my life,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">so abruptly, what threat had I made, to a boy in 1993 or perhaps it was the admission that I didn&rsquo;t eat,<br /> that I was satanic, anorexic, a cult figure of my own mind, cross between the monstrous<br /> and angelic, what was it I revealed that I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to, what words were written in purple jelly</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">pen, what spasmodic teenage language crossed with erotic energy and bubbling lyrics<br /> of pop songs folded you in, made you want to read more and more, and then close the diary<br /> in disgust, I know you did it, Orlando, I know that in finding the answer you were looking for</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">you decided you didn&rsquo;t want what you wanted, but then the effusive apology, the guilt <br /> streaming down your mouth like grease, having eaten many chickens, having stuffed one&rsquo;s<br /> core with bold meats, black wines and lust, what crime did you over read, did I kill a rat,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">a pony, a dog, an infant, a young boy, did I smack a girl in middle school, did I take<br /> out revenge on someone in a malicious and misaligned way, did I show some promise<br /> to the ugly stars, the ugly moon did I pledge allegiance to the devil to the upside down garden?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Because suddenly I recognize the other truth of a person isn&rsquo;t in the diary itself <br /> but rather situated in the space between the diary and the transgression, the person reading <br /> the diary &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; since all diaries are constructed on this terrible loss of boundary</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">3<em>/9/1997 if there&rsquo;s a chance that I am sane I think it&rsquo;s a lost lamentation, can&rsquo;t believe</em><br /> <em>I failed my Chem test so I made myself throw up today, I did it but I&rsquo;m scared </em><br /> <em>of my health, I&rsquo;ve been reading Sylvia Plath, do you think I am meat or something?</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>The distances one will go clawing for material, the Kubla Khan of pleasure, groans</em><br /> <em>of continuity, this was written by a casual and contentious stream of thought, </em><br /> <em>delivered passively from someone I have never met and will never meet </em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>3/11/1997 I just realized that if someone read my diary </em><br /> <em>I would feel raped, violated, deformed, Look at me, I can&rsquo;t connect</em> <br /> <em>to people, when they come near me I want to kill them</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>3/12/1997 Oh my god, poetic inspiration!!!</em><br /> <em>6/1/1997 Dear Nathan, I have listened to the distance mystically, </em><br /> <em>my heels beg me to stop, my instincts, refusal is a bullet in my uncle&rsquo;s skull, refusal </em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>are my hands, my hands, formed out of a cannon, 7/15/1997 Going to Jerusalem, </em><br /> <em>went out with this guy on his motorcycle, we went up to a mountain, then </em><br /> <em>we went up to another mountain, over the Sea of Galilee, when I found out how many girls</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>he fucked I decided that I would hate him and make a bad memory </em><br /> <em>out of everything that happened, I get freaked out about diseases and stuff like that, </em><br /> <em>but this weightlessness in black space or something is a sensation </em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>I have never experienced, when you know you should be heavier like in water, </em><br /> <em>I want to tell him I could have loved him too, I know he loves women </em><br /> <em>and Pink Floyd and I love men and sex and words</em> the narrative doubling back on itself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>I like one night stands and I would do them as much as I could, this life is a slimly,</em><br /> <em>adorable double helix </em>It goes on of course, on and on, there are parts that surprise me because<br /> they are so angry, one passage, Orlando, starts <em>I told that fat-assed whore with her Prozac bible</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;"><em>and smiling face that she was a disturbing disgrace</em>, and there are sweet poems too, they <br /> are very bad sometimes, one is called &ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t bring myself to read it all the way through&nbsp; <br /> but I see it uses embarrassingly the word &ldquo;tranquility,&rdquo; and there are sayings, you might call them</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">bits of wisdom but for a teenage girl like &ldquo;If you have to judge me then Fuck You for I never<br /> felt the need to judge you&rdquo; and it makes me feel self-conscious because I probably didn&rsquo;t even<br /> make that up, Orlando, it was probably something a friend told me that resonated</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">because I was angry and hurt, and then I thought about &ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; the album that Chris&rsquo;s<br /> musical collaborator, Butterclock, made on her own to try to get over him, I listened to her electronic <br /> beauty, thought about what you said&mdash; beauty makes people who aren&rsquo;t that bright seem brighter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">And then I read all of the interviews with Butterclock online, no longer intrigued by her beauty, <br /> but rather by her desperation, and when she said she wanted to make music<br /> for desperate people who stay out in the club all night &ldquo;to forget,&rdquo; it endeared me to her</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">even though I knew she was the kind of woman who, if she saw me, would immediately<br /> perceive me as a rival, I immersed myself in her desolate disco, her furious need<br /> to stave off heartbreak before it could have a chance to lodge inside her chest and lungs</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">and I recognized myself in it, I recognized myself in the glassy way smoke rises <br /> from a glass heart, that isn&rsquo;t supposed to be an ashtray but is made to be so, simply<br /> for the cheap symbolic resonance, and as the smoke lifts itself over Berlin, over Chris&rsquo;s cellphone</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">where my narrative is stored, I also thought about how she wanted to make a cheerful album, replete<br /> with cheerful sounds like crickets but how this was doomed to fail, not because it was really<br /> dark deep down like she wanted but rather because, like your magic kingdom, Orlando,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">she had placed herself above plurality in her opaque but rambunctious death drive, <br /> had wanted to control the means of production and in so doing, an aesthetic<br /> emerged confused, but not uncomplicated, and when I thought about her walking</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">through Berlin, either alone or with her lesbian girl gang or with Chris, I felt a sadness so deep,<br /> a sadness for her confusion, and I dreamed that she would meet a terrible end,<br /> but I didn&rsquo;t want to tell Chris that, didn&rsquo;t want him to know what he already must suspect</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">embedded between the synths, I listened to her track &ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; over and over, and even<br /> if her lyrics are mediocre, much like the poem &ldquo;Fantasy,&rdquo; from my diary when she sings<br /> the words &ldquo;confused inside&rdquo; I understand she means a series of broken summers like this one,</p>
<p style="font-size: 8.5pt;">violence in hotels, the way the procession of June, July, August and the first few weeks of September<br /> are never inside the domain of the real, that they are in fact, fantasy&rsquo;s double narrative,&nbsp; <br /> the mythic anguish of Butterclock, unable to break the magic circle, unable to reverse the fiction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
