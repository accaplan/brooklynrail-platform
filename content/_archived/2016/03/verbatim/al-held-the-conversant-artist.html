title: 'AL HELD: The&nbsp;Conversant&nbsp;Artist'
---

<br/>
<p>Recorded conversations with artists offer unparalleled first-hand insight into the creative process. For Al Held, in particular, the format served as a vital pulpit for communication. Held was never modest in front of the microphone: one oral history interview, conducted in 1975, comprises over ten hours of conversation. </p>!!img1!!
<p>In 1976, Andr&eacute; Emmerich interviewed Held, an interchange that underscores an artist-dealer relationship that valued the genesis and substance of works of art over their utility in the market. During their long relationship, which spanned from 1963 until the Andr&eacute; Emmerich Gallery was sold in 1996, Held was interviewed many times at his studios by Emmerich, who frequently photographed the artist at work. </p>
<p>In an excerpt from the 1976 interview, Held explains how one might find a language to understand his large paintings of overlapping geometric forms. &ldquo;Structure&rdquo; gives way to &ldquo;simultaneity&rdquo; and then, ultimately, to algebra, as ways of locating a language by which to describe his recent works.</p>
<p>The twenty-eight-page interview transcript has remained unpublished, and is part of the Al Held archives maintained by the Al Held Foundation. Notations on the typed pages are in Held&rsquo;s hand. </p>
