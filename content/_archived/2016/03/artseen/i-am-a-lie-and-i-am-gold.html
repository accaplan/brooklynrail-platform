<p align="right">&ldquo;On the surface an intelligible lie; Underneath, the unintelligible truth&rdquo;<br />
  &#151;Milan Kundera, <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></p>
<p>The familiar image of Diane Arbus&rsquo;s iconic twins greet viewers by the entrance. Yet something is immediately amiss&#151;it is not a photograph but a meticulously enlarged replica of the image drawn in pencil. Daniel Davidson&rsquo;s <em>Mirror (Diane Arbus) </em>(2015) gives the first hint at the challenges of this exhibit. Three rooms of the gallery have been packed with a wide range of work, from text-based pieces to traditional oil paintings. Although not a single photograph is on display, each artwork addresses an old concern: &ldquo;How has photography influenced our perception?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Playfully titled after a line of &ldquo;I Am a Photograph,&rdquo; a song by the disco queen Amanda Lear, the exhibit <em>I am a Lie and I am Gold </em>differs from most current studies of photography. Rid of cynicism, the exhibition is filled with seductive and challenging pieces that emphasize the open-ended nature of the medium. The curator, Marco Breuer (known for his intricate camera-less abstract photography and his continuous efforts to broaden the medium) has carefully assembled the pieces to transform the initial question into a deep study of the medium as a fluid phenomenon. &ldquo;Photography is a principle, not a product,&rdquo; states the press release.</p>
<p>Mel Bochner&rsquo;s famous <em>Misunderstandings (A Theory of Photography)</em> (1967 &#150; 1970), opens the conversation in the first room. This piece&#151;the only residue of the last century&#151;consists of ten offset cards. Handwritten on each is a quote. The authors vary immensely, from Mao to Wittgenstein and Duchamp, but each make a statement about the medium. Proust announces, &ldquo;Photography is the product of complete alienation.&rdquo; Encyclopedia Britannica dictates the counterargument: &ldquo;Photography cannot record abstract ideas.&rdquo; As a whole, the authoritative definitions, all equally profound and insufficient, mock themselves. Bochner implicitly calls for a balanced and unbiased exploration of the medium.</p>

<p>Breuer takes up the challenge, creating a two-sided narrative of the relationship between photography and its environment: one group practices their own mediums while accepting and embracing the photographic perception and the other explores other mediums to highlight their photographic concerns.</p>
<p>The artists exploring their own medium but adopting a &ldquo;photographic perception&rdquo; provide much of the visual and emotional impact of the exhibition. Marcin Cienski presents impressive photo-based oil paintings. <em>By the Stove</em> (2012) depicts a middle-aged woman caught by a harsh flashlight in a dark domestic environment. Looking down upon the interrupted heroine to catch a fragile moment, the artist underscores photography&rsquo;s ability to create intimacy. Others like Martin Wilner employ photography for its ability to tap into the subconscious. <em>October 2014, Marco Breuer</em> (2014), resulted from a month-long collaboration between the artist/psychotherapist and Breuer. Breuer committed to submit a photograph of his creative process everyday; Wilner would then use them to create a final piece, a two-sided panel. On one side, he makes small drawings of Breuer&rsquo;s submission&#151;as thumbnails&#151;and on the other he creates an intricate, surreal diagram/drawing that withholds his analysis. </p>

<p>The second group, immensely varied in concept, create a layered criticism of the medium. Some artists examine the medium&rsquo;s usage. Davide Cantoni meditates on the information lost in photo-journalism. His painting, <em>&ldquo;Afghan Elder </em>(2007) portrays an elderly bearded man from a familiar source photograph. After decades of antagonistic stereotyping by the mass media, the title and facial hair are enough to turn the depicted man into a feared guerrilla fighter. But this piece is painted in translucent Acrylic paint. From a distance the piece appears as an empty canvas; only by stepping closer is the image of the man revealed. His haunting gaze reproaches the viewers, questioning the attached stigma. Other investigations are socially based. Glenn Ligon&rsquo;s <em>Self- Portrait at Eleven Years Old </em>(2004) is a painting duplicating an iconic photograph of Stevie Wonder. By mocking his own adolescent fabrication, he points to the role of popular imagery in conditioning one&rsquo;s identity. Others examine our contemporary photo-bombarded world. Anna Plesset presents <em>The Pretense of Beauty I: Mulberry Harbour, Arromanches (Golden Arrow)</em> (2015), a small oil painting of a landscape; what might have once been viewed as sublime is now reduced to pure banality.</p>
<p>Whether it is artists with other practices yielding to today&rsquo;s photo-culture or the inside arguments of photographers, the core questions spiral towards the concept of photography. In a separate room, Molly Springfield presents detailed replicas of scanned photography textbooks. In <em>Under the Sign of Saturn </em>(2015)&#151;based on Susan Sontag&rsquo;s book of the same name&#151;Springfield meticulously paints a double page, half filled with paragraphs of text. The artist carefully recreates all the appearance, including the the paper&rsquo;s scratches from the scan and the text describing a photograph. The text is transformed to a painting, cognition and imagination called upon, and so the photograph is reborn from a memory.</p>

<p>As inclusive as Breuer&rsquo;s collection is, it is still comprised of only European and American artists with the single exception of Cynthia Lin&#151;<em>Crop2YCsidemouth41407 </em>(2007), a mesmerizing large black-and-white abstraction that, isolated here, fails to communicate beyond the surface. Confining his investigation to the familiar Euro-centric narrative makes it easy to dismiss the importance of the social, political, and historical context in shaping the medium. Breuer&rsquo;s epic study remains confined within the image and refuses to include&#151;or fails to explain&#151;the emergence of the contemporary social/conceptual photographic works. Still Breuer&rsquo;s broad illustration of both&#151;diametrically opposed&#151;ends of photography is impressive. <em>I am a Lie and I am Gold </em>is a much-needed study of the medium in action. While stemming from a contemporary angst, it is a celebration of the medium&rsquo;s endless possibilities.</p>
