<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Speeding Down the FDR</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Dressing himself in the cab for one room then another.
  The new fame on the radio playing&#151;past the cathedrals, 
  toward the young graves after that.
  In the dusk, they sold flowers to everyone 
  stopped at our red light. In this life you&rsquo;re far. 
  Like the sun appears to the water when late.
  All those people you see, all the hallways you drink in;
  through tunnels and traffic&#151;you might wear a tie,
  you might keep your shoes on forever today. 
  <em>Let them photograph your soul</em>, says Jimmy.
  <em>Memorize your alleys</em>, take yourself back home.
  Already we&rsquo;re here and already we&rsquo;re through it. 
  The toll&rsquo;s blinking wildly at you.
  They&rsquo;ll stop you from smoking indoors, they&rsquo;ll arrest you.
  But no one can stop you from kissing the wrong kind of men.
  Up ahead, a police car lights up like a kids fair. 
  The phone in my hand won&rsquo;t keep still. 
  Maybe it&rsquo;s you and you&rsquo;re driving the wrong way;
  a feeling you hailed once.
  Something to steer you toward me then away.
  If the shirt&rsquo;s fitted well, ten blocks and it&rsquo;s off you.
  If the light starts to bother, let it grow darker still.
  I was speeding down the FDR one night,
  it was August and heavy. 
  I am speeding down the FDR tonight,
  it is April and dead. Who would drive himself away?
  There&rsquo;s a stranger who&rsquo;s doing it for me.
  Who would drive herself below?
  Like a bath in street clothes.
  Eyes on the throat, money counted to zero.
  And everyone&rsquo;s cleaned up like heaven. 
  Believe it. Everyone&rsquo;s dressed down for hell.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Speeding Down PCH</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Almost arriving, I&rsquo;ve gone somewhere else. 
  You threw so much of yourself getting where, 
  going far, like the waves growing restless 
  in a white convertible&nbsp;speeding&nbsp;down PCH. 
  Who could lie? It&rsquo;s still such a pleasure and panic 
  to wake up alone, unable to answer 
  one person instead of two. 
  I arrange the pills into hearts, spread them over the desk: 
  we are not mathematics. 
  When the waiter tells me his name 
  it&rsquo;s the part of the meal I like most. 
  I am never coming back. 
  Even if the setting is different, even if the plan 
  is to speed through it twice. A vase&#151;some familiar face 
  instead of a clock on a mantel. 
  A video of a person with both hands in his hair. 
  I come to your door, get you off, 
  watch you shave in the morning. 
  Through the hurry (inside the waiting) 
  I realize the director is someone who doesn&rsquo;t show up. 
  Like the end of the day, I am orange for more 
  and in minutes I go dark. 
  What you&rsquo;ll find is our lives are addictions:
  money, love, gossip. Gossip, love, work.
  And if the video plays as it should, 
  both hands do come&nbsp;down. 
  The hair&rsquo;s going any which way and the gaze 
  can&rsquo;t be read&#151;even looking into the camera is dying. 
  Why fight it. If you die enough times 
  you become your own saint.</p>
