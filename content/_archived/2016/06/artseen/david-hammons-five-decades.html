title: DAVID HAMMONS Five&nbsp;Decades
---

<p align="center">MNUCHIN GALLERY | MARCH 15 &#150; MAY 27, 2016</p>
<p>David Hammons is still an anomaly with a gift for turning social absurdities into witticism. Though he has abandoned the perverse (more on this to follow), I wondered what his retrospective, <em>Five Decades&#151;</em>with its blatant ridicule of cultural stereotypes, capitalism, class-resource disparity, and art-world peculiarities&#151;was doing at Mnuchin Gallery in the Upper East Side, a neighborhood that is around eighty percent white and statistically holds more Republicans than most places in Manhattan. Then again, he&rsquo;s spent his five-decade career sarcastically taunting us with our own predictability.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Hammons first rattled the art world in the 1960s during the height of the controversial Black Arts Movement (BAM), then again by famously (or infamously) pissing on a Richard Serra sculpture, and then again by refusing gallery representation. Today, a survey of the artist&rsquo;s career confiscates the entirety of Mnuchin&rsquo;s neoclassical, townhouse-style space. Asian music of undulating tempos ripples and trembles as the show&rsquo;s backdrop score, where Hammons&rsquo;s personal photographs are littered around mixed-media works of a broad spectrum. Relieved of the stiffening silences and fluorescent lights of white-box galleries, I moved slightly with the beat. </p>
<p>A lingering affable tenor persists in Hammons&rsquo;s constructs of satire, puns, and one-liners, ranging from the pensive, to the academic, to the excruciatingly literal. Among the literal is <em>Untitled (Freudian Slip) </em>(1995), a photograph of a beady-eyed alien who&rsquo;s maneuvered itself up the hem of a sheer pink lingerie slip. Though comparable deadpan works deliver respite from melancholy, they pale before the dominating politically hefty ones, like <em>Untitled (Free Nelson Mandela) </em>(1987), a photograph of Hammons&rsquo;s <em>Free Nelson Mandela </em>(1987) sculpture that reflects his more brazen art-activism.</p>
<p>Hammons synthesizes object and language, flaunting his humor and politics, sometimes even toying with the contra for a laugh at nefarious sarcasm. Three microphones of herculean proportion, <em>Which Mike do you want to be like&#133;? </em>(2001)&#151;Mike Tyson, Michael Jordan, or Michael Jackson&#151;seems jovial until it resonates as a jab at cyclical poverty and its narrowed escape paths. Likewise, <em>Orange Is The New Black </em>(2014), a rustic orange-painted Nkondi sculpture depicting two dogs nailed together, recalls Piper Kerman&rsquo;s Netflix series&#151;a humorous, theatrical facsimile of her time in a women&rsquo;s &ldquo;minimum security&rdquo; prison&#151;before the sobering, grim signifiers of America&rsquo;s orange jumpsuits register. But Hammons persists beyond this slap at the germinating criminal justice system with the added critique, which surfaces from the Congolese Nkondi sculpture&rsquo;s cultural weight as a symbol of human-to-human vice. Viewing Hammons&rsquo;s work is never a quick, linear experience; it is more like an archeological dig for the jokes, the homages, and the messages.</p>
<p>Also scattered around Mnuchin&rsquo;s rooms are unironic criticisms of capitalism and highbrow academia, which seem more palatable for many Upper-East Siders. A prime example of the artist&rsquo;s satirical parodies on free enterprise is <em>Untitled (Snowball) </em>(1983/2003)&#151;a snow-globe shape with a whitish-gray opaque &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; secured atop its wooden base&#151;that recalls the time when Hammons sold actual snowballs on the Bowery as part of his performance piece <em>Bliz-aard Ball Sale </em>(1983). Yet <em>Untitled (Snowball) </em>ripens with the framed e-mail exchange between a collector and a dealer, which hangs adjacently: &ldquo;As much as we would love to own a snowball, not a single insurance company would cover it for us [. . .] And since we are not made of money like SOME people [. . .] we will have to pass.&rdquo; Evoking art-market capitalism and the commodification of basic resources, classist politics become warped through innuendo.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a recognizable mockery of art criticism, <em>Untitled (Tribal Art) </em>(2007) pictures a 1997 issue of <em>Artforum</em>, which the artist has trophied within a vitrine. This particular <em>Artforum</em> features Ai Weiwei and Marcel Broodthaers; yet with conviction to institutional critique, Hammons has blasted across the cover, &ldquo;TRIBAL ART,&rdquo; in thick, red font, above where the original cover reads, &ldquo;ARE YOU CONFUSED?&rdquo; He is one of the few artists to fracture the intellectual barriers prescribed by elitist jargon through his exposure of the hyper-intellectual language that preserves the art-world&rsquo;s exclusive terrain. Only a handful of artists have so deliberately challenged those who hold market leverage, notwithstanding the historic scope of &ldquo;political&rdquo; artists and their propaganda work surrounding feminism, war, civil rights, among much more.</p>
<p>Within Hammons&rsquo;s broad body of work, <em>Five Decades </em>is a collective reminder that &ldquo;life is a cosmic joke and humankind is incorrigible.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> The show alleges that art, class, race, education, and the entirety of American society is politicized, a notion of particular substance as we recognize that the civic weight of Hammons&rsquo;s motifs have synonymously prevailed since the &rsquo;60s. But inklings of optimism nest within the disassociation between Hammons&rsquo;s work and Mnuchin Gallery; if artist and gallery can collectively revise orthodoxies, perhaps there is prospect for demolishing the cultural, educational, and class-structure barriers that have disenfranchised many groups of individuals from the arts.</p>
<p>Hammons has visited Mnuchin unannounced on a handful of occasions to make changes to <em>Five Decades </em>and its configurations&#151;adding, removing, and shuffling works, even eliminating text labels for ones written directly on the white walls. A head-shaped rock, <em>Untitled </em>(2004), topped with afro-textured hair, was substituted for a head-shaped rock of a different fade called <em>Untitled (One Stone Head) </em>(1997). About three weeks before closing, Hammons pragmatically swapped <em>Untitled (Snowball) </em>for a glass of water (e-mail remaining). New photographs were added while some were awkwardly moved to look like they&rsquo;d fallen off the wall. The space seemed to progressively empty, as if we were witnessing capacious dilapidation over a small two-month window. Most importantly, Hammons has personalized our experiences of the show: those who only visited once are oblivious; those who saw it more than once strain to harmonize its changes with one&rsquo;s own memory; and art critics scramble to revise &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that are no longer factual. </p>
