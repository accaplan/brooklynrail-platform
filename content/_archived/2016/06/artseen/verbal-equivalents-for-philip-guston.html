<div style="margin-left:110px;margin-right:100px;">
<p>the breathing of and listening </p>
<p>to paint</p>
<p>the openness, sensuousness, messiness&#151;the restlessness</p>
<p>paint becomes a sentient thing</p>
<p>divesting what we already know</p>
<p>with urgency, courage, freedom, directness</p>
<p>the eye watching the eye paint</p>
<p>turning fidgety anxiety to mindful and feeling action, the agitation acting upon resistance of matter: </p>
<p>spindly accretions of clumsy forms, brooding gestures, diffuse edges, nervous measures</p>
<p>of body, traces of hand</p>
<p>thinking out loud</p>
<p>the enigma, the mystery, the empty vessel of doubt</p>
<p align="left">places, people and states nearly emerge from pure material, conjured by titles: traveler, actor, the room, path, alchemist, garden, winter, vessel</p>
<p align="left">non-scape, greyscape, brushscrape, zigzagscape, <br>
  innerscape, sootscape</p>
<p>the brimming vessel of possibility</p>
<p>doubt itself acculumates form</p>
<p align="left">arachnid meandering, muscle-memory wandering, octopoid reach</p>
<p>of bristling weave:</p>
<p align="left">the third hand, the empathy of thought and feeling: tangibilis</p>
<p>in touch we feel for others, we&rsquo;re all hoods</p>
<p align="left">the distillation of thinking and doing, what is concealed and hidden</p>
<p align="left">following the mistakes<br>
  the surface seems alive 
  paint disappears</p>
