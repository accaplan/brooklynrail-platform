<li>June 4: Long Distance Music at the <a href="http://blankforms.org/seminars/labyrinth-gives-way-to-skin-long-distance-music-seminar-2/">Emily Harvey Foundation</a>. The second installment in the Labyrinth Gives Way to Skin series producing the work of Maryanne Amacher, Long Distance Music presents four of Amacher&#146;s City-Links projects, for which the artist transmitted live sonic feeds from different cities, incorporating them into installations, performances, and radio broadcasts. Jean-Luc Godard once spoke of cinema&#146;s ability to convey &#147;the news from where I&#146;m from&#148;; Wolf Haas wrote a novel titled <em>The Weather Fifteen Years Ago</em>. Amacher&#146;s project would seem to encapsulate both.</li><br/>
<li>June 4 - 10: <a href="http://www.next-fest.org">The Next Festival of Emerging Artists</a>. Covering (le) poisson rouge to Albany, this festival features a unique juxtaposition: two performances of new music by violist Nadia Sirota, and two concerts of new songs by Richard Thompson, all on different days so as to avoid mental confusion.</li><br/>

<li>June 12: International Anthem Summer Showcase at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/984112518292704/">(le) poisson rouge</a>. One of the most exciting new labels, Chicago&#8217;s International Anthem is already digging in deep with new jazz that has one foot in deep grooves and the other in abstraction, a combination for head and heart. This showcase features drummer and bandleader Makaya McCraven, the Jaimie Branch Quartet, and the great Chicago Underground Duo of Rob Mazurka and Chad Taylor.<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TakzTVNMGiM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li><br/>

Aimed at young people, this story and music is truly for all audiences.</li><br/>
<li>June 19 - July 1: <a href="http://www.jazztopad.pl">Jazztopad Festival</a>. Jazz had an important place in Polish artistic life in the 20th century&#151;it was a field for intellectual and expressive exploration and freedom, and was an essential part of Polish cinema of the mid-century. Held at various venues, the Jazztopad festival keeps this great tradition alive with performances from the Obara International Quartet, the Marcin Wasilewski Trio, Piotr Damasiewicz, Tony Malaby, and a bevy of fine musicians.</li><br/>
<li>June 20: Downtown Music Gallery 25th Anniversary Celebration and Benefit at <a href="http://roulette.org">Roulette</a>. How many record stores are left in New York City, maybe two handfuls? Of these, Downtown Music Gallery is the most important, vital place for experimental music of all kinds, the place you go and drop all your cash because you can&#8217;t believe what it is you found. How important? Here are the artists offering their talents for this benefit (and real celebration): Zion80 playing the music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and John Zorn via, Burnt Sugar Arkestra and their post-electric Miles/funk/conduction mix led by the estimable Greg Tate, and Bill Laswell&#8217;s Method of Defiance.</li><br/>
<li>June 25: Dave Harrington&#146;s Merry Pranksters at <a href="http://www.roughtradenyc.com/event/1187265-dave-harringtons-merry-brooklyn">Rough Trade</a>. Harrington, known for his work in Darkside with Nicolas Jaar and in countless collaborations with other Brooklyn musicians such as Sunwatchers, brings together a nine-piece ensemble playing &#147;groove-based improvisations inspired by jazz-fusion of the 70s&#148; and, presumably, Ken Kesey&#146;s Kool-Aid crew.<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3AMQCf4lj4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li><br/>
<li>June 29: Bernhard Lang&#8217;s <em>The Cold Trip</em> at the <a href="www.afcny.org">Austrian Cultural Forum</a>. Of the current crop of composers coming out of central Europe, Bernhard Lang is the most interesting, surprising, witty, and entertaining. In the absence of a much needed Composer Portrait at Miller Theatre, catch his re-imagining of Schubert&#8217;s <em>Winterreise</em>, seen through Lang&#8217;s unique compositional repetition and fractured looping. Played by the Aleph Guitar Quartet, the program also has music from Georg Friedrich Haas and Alberto Hortig&uuml;ela, and is free with a reservation.</li><br/>
<li>July 1: <a href="https://ziemba.bandcamp.com/">Ziemba</a> at Ten Pins Tavern. The New York artist and musician has a debut record, <em>Hope Is Never</em>, coming out June 24th&#151;pop music featuring a cozy yet expansive sonic palette, with Ren&eacute; Kladzyk&#146;s voice floating gently above.<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c28k3gbY2ho" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li><br/>
