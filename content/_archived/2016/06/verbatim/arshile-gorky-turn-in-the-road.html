<p>The magical beauty of Arshile Gorky&rsquo;s paintings and drawings is inseparable from biographical legend. Abstract psychological landscapes like <em>Garden in Sochi</em> and <em>The Betrothal</em> yearn to reclaim childhood and homeland lost to genocidal campaigns in Gorky&rsquo;s native Armenia. The visual source for <em>The Artist and his Mother</em> is a personal artifact: a coveted photograph of Shushan Adoian and her young son Vosdanig Adoian&#151;Gorky&rsquo;s given name.</p>
<p>Vosdanig emigrated to the United States in 1920; by 1924 he had begun to reinvent himself, adopting the pseudonym Arshile Gorky. In New York, his immense intelligence as a painter and ability to navigate the possibilities of abstract modernism energized colleagues who, in turn, transformed American art. Counterbalancing such brilliance, however, were crushing personal tragedies that ultimately suffocated Gorky&rsquo;s artistic output and cut short his life. </p>
<p>On the evening of June 24, 1948 Gorky was returning to the Glass House, his home in Sherman, Connecticut; his dealer, Julien Levy, was behind the wheel. Levy lost control of his car, and the ensuing crash left Gorky unable to use his right arm&#151;his painting arm&#151;and bound within an uncomfortable iron and leather neck brace. As the extant traffic citation perfunctorily notes, Levy most likely was speeding as he failed to negotiate a curve on a wet Route 67, in New Milford. Like so many elements that comprise Gorky&rsquo;s biography, however, the actual circumstances remain unclear. Levy, in a later memoir, would invoke the specter of Gorky&rsquo;s absent and increasingly estranged wife, Mougouch (Agnes) as a dark and extenuating force. Levy&rsquo;s wife Muriel, in the car but uninjured recalled,&rdquo;Oh God, Julien was the world&rsquo;s worst driver and he&rsquo;d had a lot to drink that day.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;Struggling without the immediate presence of his family and without the ability to engage in painting as a palliative, Gorky ended his life not long after the crash. Words from an interview conducted earlier that year presaged his fate:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">I don&rsquo;t like that word &ldquo;finish.&rdquo; When something is finished, that mean&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s dead, doesn&rsquo;t it? I believe in everlastingness. I never finish a painting&#151;I just stop working on it for a while. I like painting because it&rsquo;s something I can never come to the end of </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">[. . .] The thing to do is to always keep starting to paint, never finish painting.<sup>2</sup></p><br/>
