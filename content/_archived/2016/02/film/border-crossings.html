<em>The Films of Claire Denis: Intimacy on the Border</em> 
(I. B. Tauris, 2014) </strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a contemporary filmmaker more searching or mercurial than Claire Denis; her films aren&rsquo;t unclassifiable, exactly, but they inevitably frustrate attempts at description that favor story, character, or identity politics. They are genre-defying collages: of flesh and landscape, concrete and countryside, clear-eyed analysis and flesh-bound fetish. It&rsquo;s appropriate, then, that the very fine new volume <em>The Films of Claire Denis: Intimacy on the Border</em>, edited by Marjorie Vecchio, is something of a grab-bag. Vecchio has wisely set critical essays alongside interviews with both Denis and her collaborators, and the result is a welcome addition to the dearth of English-language criticism on Denis. The book examines her work from a multitude of angles without for one moment pretending that she can&#151;or should&#151;be safely pinned down with reference to either other filmmakers or academic/theoretical &ldquo;movements.&rdquo;</p>!!img1!!
<p>Vecchio, in her preface, explains that any physical borders the geographically promiscuous Denis concerns herself with are secondary to the &ldquo;intimate ones [&#133;] between children and parents, siblings neighbors, strangers, old friends and lovers.&rdquo; Denis&rsquo;s protagonists form a multivalent collection of individuals in close battle &ldquo;who are always encircled by larger [. . .] borders such as class, race, country, gender, politics, and land.&rdquo; Recall the boundaries set for the the French legionnaires in <em>Beau Travail</em>, defined by the state and their &ldquo;work&rdquo;&#151;which includes border enforcement&#151;and then recall what we actually remember about that film: the intimate grapplings of bodies and souls, the ultimate transcendence in the crossing of the line between life on earth and whatever ecstatic nightclub purgatory comes next.</p>
<p>Denis&rsquo;s films, then, are attempts to both acknowledge the presence of these various borders and to ultimately reconfigure them; her work, writes Vecchio, &ldquo;constantly pushes the concept of personal agency against the boundaries of unquestioned allegiance, nationalism, stupidity, innocence, and multi-culturalism.&rdquo; The inclusion of that last &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; may come as a shock to certain progressive readers not used to hearing multiculturalism described as a site surrounded by a fence, but Vecchio is here referring to analytical frameworks that would attempt to comfortably shoehorn Denis, who spent some of her formative years in several French colonies of Africa, into a comfortable position of post-colonial protest art.</p>
<p>Indeed, as both the interviews with Denis and the book&rsquo;s best essays make clear, definitive <em>identification </em>is anathema to this filmmaker. In the words of James S. Williams, &ldquo;Identity for Denis can only ever be an experience of exile or marginality,&rdquo; and family is only ever provisional, always diasporic. It is no accident that the best work here examines Denis&rsquo;s slippery&#151;and, I think, ultimately radical&#151;notion of a conception of others (or the Other, if you like) that is <em>necessarily</em> outside of prescribed bonds of family and nation, and which Denis renders accordingly: as fractured, disorienting, frequently violent, and, just as frequently (and sometimes in the same breath) heart-stoppingly beautiful. Williams and Sam Ishii-Gonzales, in two of the book&rsquo;s centerpiece essays, navigate different facets of what Ishii-Gonzales terms Denis&rsquo;s &ldquo;non-relational relations&rdquo; in prose that is both fleet and relatively free of theoretical jargon.</p>
<p>Rounding out the book are the aforementioned conversations with Denis; interviews with current and former collaborators (including members of Tindersticks, Denis&rsquo;s in-house band); individual examinations of thorny masterworks such as <em>Trouble Every Day </em>and <em>The Intruder</em>; and a wonderful concluding piece by Adam Nayman and Andrew Tracy which discusses Denis&rsquo;s bloody-minded relationship to the horror-centric, and at one time academically fashionable, &ldquo;New French Extremity&rdquo; movement. There will no doubt be more English-language books about Claire Denis, but it is hard to imagine a more comprehensive and sensitive one than this. In the meantime, we can await the borders drawn&#151;and penetrated&#151;in her forthcoming film, reportedly written by Zadie Smith and Nick Laird. It&rsquo;s set in outer space. </p>
