<br/>
<p>Leticia thought that she was receiving a certified check for 85 pesos, but her bank, by mistake, made it for 48.7 million pesos. The next day, Leticia went to cash the check without having realized the error, until the bank gave her two boxes full of 500 peso bills, and she went straight home. Immediately, she packed a suitcase with clothing and two with the bills. While she loaded the suitcases into her car, she felt like a drug trafficker, or, well, that drug traffickers must feel this way when they traveled with so much cash, and she liked the idea. She arrived at the city in Yucat&aacute;n that she liked so much. She stayed in a hotel for a week; she hired a lawyer who, for a generous sum, got her a new birth certificate. The same lawyer acquired a house to Leticia&rsquo;s taste in a stupendous neighborhood, and she bought a new, aerodynamic car with a sunroof, obtained furniture, curtains, and decorations; everything stupendous, agreeable. And she changed herself. She hired one of the best surgeons in the city, who gave her a pretty face and body like a TV actress; again, with the help of her lawyer, she got new documents for everything, like voter credentials, a passport, and everything else. In a luxurious restaurant, she met Christopher and they soon moved in together in her mansion, where she bought him a comfortable car. One Sunday, when they were walking near the main plaza, machine guns opened fire on them from two cars. For quite some time, Leticia and Christopher looked like rag dolls that could not fall to the ground due to bursts of gunfire that kept them upright and formed stars of clothing and blood on the couple until they both collapsed. When the vehicles departed and vanished, the people in the main plaza continued running in different directions, distancing themselves from the blasts. The next day, the local newspapers, in their four column headlines, stated that the drug trafficker Lino T&eacute;llez, alias El Christopher, had fallen to pieces beside a beautiful woman, his accomplice. </p><br/>
