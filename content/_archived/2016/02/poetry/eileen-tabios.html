Love is always haggled&#151;Truth is disembodied&#151;
  Mahogany dining tables with royal lengths fail 
  to include&#151;Search defined as tipping Bing cherries </p>
<p>
into a blue bowl until sky becomes lost to a crimson 
  moon&rsquo;s overflow&#151;Bones become hollow, flutes made 
  from reeds&#151;Entrancement&rsquo;s target? The layered auras </p>
<p>
of decay&#151;Breasts sculpted on immobilized Virgin Marys&#151;
  A green calyx emphasizes the burden of a generously-
  watered corolla&#151;Then discover the limited utility of calm </p>
<p>
seas&#151;Failure defined as appreciating a <em>delicadeza</em> moon
  -light as much as any long-haired maiden&#151;Lapse to the 
  stance of cliffs meeting water&#151;Or camouflage the body</p>
<p>

For someone still anticipated, she released milk 
  to orphaned baby birds&#151;It was not a blood teardrop
  but the last red pepper hanging from a string </p>
<p>
in front of a white wall&#151;Water becomes like love: 
  miserable and lovely&#151;Memory contains an under
  -brush&#151;The inevitability of ashes&#151;Revelation as </p>
<p>
a water lily forming instantaneously&#151;Laughter 
  comprised of stars&#151;It seemed the sun hummed 
  along&#151;That plasticity of recognition: silk, moonlight, </p>
<p>
velvet, cr&egrave;me brulee, honey on fingertip, awkward 
  blood&#151;Pride more adept than eye in discerning

Audacity, at times, must be a private affair&#151;Birthland 
  defined as an island replete with chastened alleyways&#151;
  Sentences like veins&#151;The Introduction as a permanent</p>

  landscape of Gambia&#151;The relish of pronunciation: 
  &ldquo;Burkina Faso&rdquo;&#151;You were drowning in the Seychelles</p>
<p>
&#151;relishing the uncomprehended word: &ldquo;Seychelles&rdquo;&#151;
  Gardenias crushed for perfume entrusted with 
  cancelling midnights&#151;Tentative acacia trees waiting </p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Footnotes to Bliss</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Oh, the joy of eliding the vocabulary found in margins! 
  Jessamine wafting over the paddock&#151;You spilling vermouth 
  on the sky&#151;Losing the language of scars, we shook lanterns </p>
<p>
to bestow frankincense and myrrh&#151;<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Sympathy for</span> Affinity with 
  tender hours&#151;Hiding behind a curtain, someone&rsquo;s neighbor 
  watched and wrote a haiku about a thief tangoing with his </p>
<p>
shadow when the moon appeared&#151;My son flung his leather 
  jacket over a puddle intersecting with my path across Bluemner
  Street&#151;Lurked forever in a red telephone booth to look up </p>
<p>
at rain and your window&#151;&ldquo;Ideal Violet&rdquo; made immortal by petals
  blushing during the lemonade days of summer&#151;Dew lingering 
  on a carnation corsage left on a bench&#151;Popcorn spilt on the floor</p>
<p>
of a darkened movie theater: when butter gleamed, the dispensable
  became nuggets of gold&#151;Too often, the world should be veiled&#151;
  Never forget the starving Arab boy who wove a rug now hanging </p>
<p>
above the Spanish Queen&rsquo;s bed&#151;A boy grinned around a peeking
  tongue as he folded silver foil into an eagle&#151;Gratitude defined as
  saying things I&rsquo;ve never said before&#151;Returning with tea leaves </p>
<p>
from a tiny stall in Kathmandu&#151;The charm bracelet that required 
  only one charm&#151;Damp eyes not mine&#151;If you call an island &ldquo;Isla 
  Mujeres,&rdquo; half of the population will be anguished&#151;The pillow still </p>
<p>
shielding a stray tooth because someone believed in a fairy tale&#151;
  When mortality&rsquo;s significance is that wars end&#151;To be human is 
  to be forgiven&#151;A snowfall of daisies whose mottles under moonlight </p>
<p>
twinkled like a saddhu&rsquo;s eyes&#151;Taste of your mouth? Song of licorice&#151;
Releasing breath 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to describe milk transformed by your scent&#151;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Penetrating rot&#151;The bloat of betterment&#151;
  Slickness profuse, then ahems of misfires&#151;
  Aura become scant&#151;Sympathy over </p>
<p>
the ne&rsquo;er-do-well&rsquo;s dejection&#151;The fashioned
  buttress of factionalism&#151;There is no cavalry&#151;
  Psoriasis enabling disparagement&#151;The janitor</p>
<p>
&rsquo;s behavior determined by ulcer&#151;Sparse iridescence&#151;

  credibility&#151;The many keys to the same void&#151;</p>

Gravestone outmaneuvering all&#151;</p>
