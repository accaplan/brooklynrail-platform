Make orders have been transmitted.
  Ports and distances will be crossed. 
  Nimble digits screw on my head.
  My torso is like a song of silicon. 
  Against the surface of a thousand floors
  I am tested and ready to depart.
  Screaming faxes guarantee arrival.
  Dials are knuckled by important VPs.
  Toll booth operators are standing by
  across continents. Logs contain
  pixelated command strings. I am
  shipped. Tools of the toolmakers
  have been used on me. The million
  beads of voided sweat fugitively fall.
  Chemists and model-casters have
  cut me down to size. Pressure gauges 
  allay fears of transit packaging. 
  Tiny geometrics plot the drive.
  Carrier vans come for cardboard.
  I clatter at large unloading docks
  in the ermine density of morning. 
  Ingenious forklifts bury me in hulls.
  Sweetly jammed into a simulacra, 
  mildewed docking gates fly open.
  Rudder struts applied are tightening.
  Cargos push off to sea like crayons 
  in a bathtub. Deadbolts drop in buckets.
  Hangar bays seal my fate like manic
  Disney teacups carving curving lanes.
  Roadie radios facilitate my insurance.
  Purchased policies don&rsquo;t deny me.
  Carpets sterilize; coffeemakers bristle.
  Satellite spunk relays my coordinates.
  Vendors clock their rushed dispersals. 
  Tongues become hatches hatching. 
  Repairs swing into being after toupees 
  are combed, conference calls had, board
  rooms waylaid, legal pads jotted on.
  Rest assured, nothing&rsquo;s happening. 
  Winds move. Circuit boards braid 
  micro-guts that manage the tides of 
  stars, a teeming sense of definition.
  Lovely human forms steer my travails. 
  Cleaning fluid sits in bulk beside me.
  Christmas morns await. Windshields
  stationed at the edge of Ohio creeks
  scratch the deep belly of Nebraska plains. 
  Crystal points establish. Data inevitable.
  Clanging horns shatter Gibraltar rocks.
  Yoda Toyotas. Dehumidifiers. And I am
  locked up, set loose, patrolled laterally,
  gauged, shuffled, blinking, hauled off.
  Near a Denny&rsquo;s in Nevada, you&rsquo;ll find me.
  Batting rackets know my name. Nothing
  richer than the rich ubiquity of plastics.
  Everything has been crushed exactly right.
  Bags of antenna parts. Toy walkie-talkies. 
  Like skin cream, I am of good use to you
  along the conveyor belt of the Pacific,
  the trillion lbs. of me pouring out, saying
  only, only, only that my love is yours. </p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Dead Girls</p><br/>
<p>
White people prefer murder
  To happen to strangers
  Viewers prefer stories about dead girls
  Though drowning is popular
  Beachfronts are popular 
  Houses by the bay
  Houses by the lake 
  Bodies of water have a long-studied relationship to suddenly passing away
  The scene is a chemistry classroom
  Daylight&rsquo;s undertaker makeup 
  My boyfriend sullen and cute
  There are flashbacks
  To dancing designer drugs
  Inside bloated McMansions
  Where deodorant commercials play on loop
  The detective learns how he hit me
  How I wore his lost necklace 
  How my BFF made out with aliens &nbsp;&nbsp;
  My life a mystery
  Everyone hungry
  The fate of my name on the lips of the curious 
  Our coach encouraged me 
  My dad bloated with grief 
  My breasts small
  My pelvis slight 
  My blue corpse is angular in daylight
  Multiple autopsies are performed
  Murder sleeps in our midst 
  A princess from Connecticut
  In the middle of life taken&nbsp; 
  Under the covers of psychiatry 
  But no one tells anything
  When they find my body
  Floating through the marsh
  My mother ghosts the room
  Worn to a stony nub&nbsp; 
  The season is almost over 
  Blood calls to blood
  The mayor and governor convene 
  Nothing can stop until the Waterfront Project&rsquo;s completed
  In my life, are you the happy girl or am I?
  In the story of my life, do you mind not knowing?</p>
