<p style="font-size: 14pt;">The Ghosts</p><br/>
<p>
Anne Sexton&rsquo;s ghost just said, I&rsquo;m watching you
  Then sent me to her Book of Beasts
  What is a Ghost
  A light peppery air being
  Or a solid, jelly thing
  The book
  I&rsquo;ve died before
  But no one believed me
  And I came back here 
  To haunt my beloved
  Then breathing
  And we washed in words, now dead again
  Now back again, I am no longer jelly 
  I&rsquo;m water, a peachy lilac color
  Both born into blue 
  For someone or something could be watching 
  Some are watching as I write this
  The ghostly comediennes I share this speech 
  Or, you know that hum 
  That goes and flows
  That&rsquo;s ghosts
  Who will be reborn eventually
  The trick is to make friends with all of them
  The trick is let the darkness out into the moonscape
  And funnel the light into one strong sound
  Only I can hear the sounds of my ancestors 
  But you can too
  What is a ghost
  A ghost is a mountain 
  It&rsquo;s green it&rsquo;s frightful
  It&rsquo;s written in Latin
  But not the kind we read anymore
  What is a ghost
  It&rsquo;s a flower
  Big and weeping with purple colors
  A weeping world, not vacuous
  What is a ghost
  It is my father
  It is my dog
  It is a dream
  I dream of people
  Do they or do they not exist
  If you think this world exists
  Then I think you do too
  If you think you are breathing now
  Then I promise the ghosts breathe down upon your neck
  What is a life
  If it&rsquo;s longing, then fuck it
  Sister, take me back to the beach
  Let&rsquo;s watch the sunset and then the moon
  If it&rsquo;s only this then put on my mask 
  And send me wheeling down the halls
  I&rsquo;ll spend the rest of days 
  Talking only to the children
  If children are ghosts
  Then put the capes upon them 
  And paint their eyes with terracotta
  Then make them cakes all day long
  Then tie the brightly-colored streamers
  If babies are ghosts then have many of them
  Then make the new new again
  If you are a ghost then let me kiss you
  And feel your faintest undertone
  If spring is ghostly then take me in it
  Then leave me in the fields until I&rsquo;m eaten
  By bees and breads
  Until I can come here
  Come here clean again 
  Wheel me down the halls
  I&rsquo;m old I&rsquo;m old
  Give mercy to my sisters, the bees
  But not to me
  I&rsquo;m not old 
  I&rsquo;m young
  Always young
  Oh youth
  Won&rsquo;t you go already
  Same drone 
  From here to neverending
  Bathing spirits
  Submerged in blue light
  Acid lake 
  I&rsquo;ll sink in
  In hot pink outlines
  No
  Behold
  The wooden lake
  I&rsquo;ll sink in 
  Again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Floral pattern </p><br/>
<p>
I feel super needy today
  The worst part of admitting this
  Is that no one will care
  This the pattern I see
  When I close my eyes too quickly
  Not a pattern of being 
  But a floral pattern from the 70s
  Yellows and oranges
  You know social media
  Is bad for me 
  People are too 
  I am 37 and still a child
  In my thinking about people
  So I avoid them entirely
  I smile
  But that&rsquo;s about it
  I&rsquo;ll never know anyone
  Ego dissolving
  Not anything 
  I will never be anything
  But that&rsquo;s ok too 
  What if anything 
  On the beach the flowers are 
  What wild
  What was ever wild
  He wrote the last thing I could be
  Not a relationship
  But in art
  He said what we were was art
  Not a need
  Not even an art need 
  What is an art need
  So full of culture
  What is a cultus
  Coitus
  My silly sublime
  Bright turquoise palm flowers
  Over a magenta hue
  Palindrome in the night
  Asking me
  For my prediction
  And upon divination
  I said it was a great love in a museum
  No I meant me
  No I mean myself
  Darling all night
  I have been flickering off on off
  Heavy as a lecher&rsquo;s kiss
  The neon lights of the overlay
  The room that will always be timeless
  Not an intrapersonal concern
  But an art one
  The moon 
  No door
  But a face in it&rsquo;s own right
  My mind
  A bloodhound
  For oblivion
  Already in the house
  Answer your phone
  Call me 
  Call me I will answer
  From inside your house
  Dripping my wares everywhere
  Answer me
  Was I really so unreposed
  Naked corpse 
  So slowly working
  Answer me
  Was I really so 
  Palindrome of shadow and light
  Not a thing of worth
  But a barmaid
  That&rsquo;s all you wanted 
  In the lilac light
  Where I gave up 
  My most sacred to you
  Without a second&rsquo;s thought
  And you answered the phone
  From another sphere
  Laughing
  Laughing at me
  Laughing </p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Become a person</p><br/>
  <p>
  The bee died upon entering the water
  What happened to his honey no one knew</p>
  <p>
  I left one fig and one kumquat
  In each dish for the host</p>
  <p>
  There were the yellow trunks of trees
  The memory of Spain</p>
  <p>
  There was the memory of being
  The memory of love</p>
  <p>
  Let the water take you in
  So your neck is just a stalk, the head blooms</p>
  <p>
  Let everything go away
  You are a person</p>
  <p>
  Be a person
  Become a person again</p>
  <p>
  The happiest he ever made me
  The table in white</p>
  <p>
  Where upon we list the white seashore
  The White Sea, the white seahorses</p>
  <p>
  They said I loved him better than anyone
  The white seashore</p>
  <p>
  No I never knew him
  The bees</p>
<p>The bees
  They know everything</p>
  <p>
  Be a person
  Be a person again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Why I Hate The Internet</p><br/>
<p>
When one is on the Internet
  In the middle of fear
  You can find a Mashable article
  About abandoned shopping malls</p>
<p>
Each image more horrible than the next
  Each click to a burned out neon room
  To an article then
  About Courtney Cox and Pennzoil</p>
<p>
Why am I tired of the Internet
  I have no friends here
  I write down words in my room
  For a thousand hours and no likes</p>
<p>
So, instead of the Internet I will make a little shop
  In an art gallery and tell no one 
  In my dirty leopard coat it will be 1992 forever
  Burned out hamburger sign in the foreseeable distance</p>
<p>
Why am I tired of the Internet
  Well where is my pussy, my old old pussy
  No, my pussy belongs in the hallowed books of yore
  Not in this time, or online</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
