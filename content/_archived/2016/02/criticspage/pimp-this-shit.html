title: Pimp This Shit
---

<p>A little over a decade ago, Mike Kelley confessed: &ldquo;Art is the only arena in American culture in which difference is tolerated. I mean, I don&rsquo;t even think it exists in politics. What scares me about contemporary art is the merging of it with the entertainment industry [&#8201;&#133;&#8201;] Because once the entertainment industry can produce fake resistance then you don&rsquo;t have real resistance.&rdquo; I assume there are some (many?) who will find my recalling his fear almost quaint&#151;except look at where this merging has delivered us. Crowdsourcing becomes critique, art a revenue stream for a concierge industry, creativity creative management, artists branding opportunities, etc. Of course, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Until it is. I&rsquo;ve made several people cry during studio visits over the years, not usually on purpose. I know of a revered sculptor who molested many of his female students. I promised not to repeat that a powerful museum director told one rising star to &ldquo;start making work that institutions [as opposed to collectors] can afford to show.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been fag-bashed by a partner of an &ldquo;internationally acclaimed&rdquo; gallery. I hear <em>private foundation</em> or <em>gift to the city</em> and think <em>tax shelter</em> and <em>cheap storage</em>. I stay home alone, skipping most openings. I once peed on Frank O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s grave and then placed stolen flowers there. Sometimes I prefer to talk, nude, to escorts rather than have them fuck me.</p>
<p>I spent most of the morning transcribing every line of dialogue that my favorite porn star (<a href="http://twitter.com/aradwinwin">@aradwinwin</a>) delivers in one of his scenes to yank me out of the doldrums, but the thought hasn&rsquo;t quite slipped my mind that if I&rsquo;m any longer writing &ldquo;about&rdquo; art at all I am writing for art because it died. Maybe not &ldquo;died.&rdquo; Avital Ronell would probably stress that since it has been obsolesced, divested,&nbsp; I must learn what to do with its remainders and trust that mourning would not necessarily preclude moments of something like festivity, but I&rsquo;m feeling about it all, what&rsquo;s the word, agnostic? <em>Disenchanted</em>? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arad&rsquo;s thick jet locks flop over his forehead as he sucks on his partner&rsquo;s cock and primes his hole digitally. He&rsquo;s already asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s true?,&rdquo; and soon declares, &ldquo;Next I want to teach you how we ride.&rdquo; Not long after the scene was shot, on his left forearm the Huma of Persepolis will be inked, &#1607;&#1605;&#1575;, auspicious creature that never alights.</p>
