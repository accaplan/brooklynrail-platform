  be Happy.1

<p>When Suzanne Hudson asked me to write for &ldquo;Ours is a City of Writers,&rdquo; I replied with few quick questions. One of them was how the compensation for such an assignment for <em>the Brooklyn Rail </em>works? Suzanne told me their group&rsquo;s guest editor fee would be split amongst the writers; I don&rsquo;t know exactly how it works for everyone involved, but of course, as you could guess, the &ldquo;honorarium&rdquo; is minimal. This is the means of cultural production&#151;to ask for something, anything, and hope one receives. As a recent <em>New York Times</em> piece highlights, BR operates on a shoestring, hustling to stay afloat, and generally offers writers no compensation for their work. The independent publication has been afloat in this manner since 1998. </p>!!img1!!
<p>How do we remain a city of writers, of artists, in these places? The same <em>New York Times</em> found that in Los Angeles, median rent is 47% of median income. The median rent in Los Angeles is $2,460 (New York is $2,331). According to UCLA&rsquo;s Ziman Center for Real Estate and LA Curbed, Los Angeles has &ldquo;the most unaffordable rental market in the U.S. [. . .] due to the fact that 52% of its inhabitants are renters&rdquo; (the national rental rate is about 35%) and &ldquo;since 1970, median rent has risen 175% in Los Angeles while median income has stayed just about flat.&rdquo; Or, in other words, &ldquo;one needs to earn at least $33 an hour&#151;$68,640 a year&#151;to be able to afford the average apartment in Los Angeles County.&rdquo; This is unmanageable and ridickulous. Enhancing this dystopic landscape is a city with no water for its population of inhabitants, not enough anymore for wildlife, flora and fauna, and dying oceans. Sunny SoCal is now home to the country&#146;s first desalination plant&mdash;the resort town of Carlsbad, California is pumping fifty million gallons per day, enough water to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool every eighteen minutes. And for what? To perpetuate crapitalist production and reproduction, growth and relaxed lifestyles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a city of hapless hopefuls at the site of a hopeless millennium. Subjects of a white supremacist murderous patriarchy that will extract everything until the end. Until it&rsquo;s all over and we have filed enough content to fill every hole. We must stop the clocks, we must stop producing for production&rsquo;s sake. We must start thinking together. As indigenous activist and academic Leanne Betasamosake Simpson stated,</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px"><em>Our elders have been warning us about this for generations now&#151;they saw the unsustainability of settler society immediately. Societies based on conquest cannot be sustained[&#133;]We&rsquo;re running out of time. We&rsquo;re losing the opportunity to turn this thing around. We don&rsquo;t have time for this massive slow transformation into something that&rsquo;s sustainable and alternative. I do feel like I&rsquo;m getting pushed up against the wall. Maybe my ancestors felt that 200 years ago or 400 years ago. But I don&rsquo;t think it matters. I think that the impetus to act and to change and to transform, for me, exists whether or not this is the end of the world. If a river is threatened, it&rsquo;s the end of the world for those fish. It&rsquo;s been the end of the world for somebody all along. And I think the sadness and the trauma of that is reason enough for me to act.</em></p>
