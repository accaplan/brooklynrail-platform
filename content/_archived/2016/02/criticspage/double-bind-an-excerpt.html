<p>[&#133;] Rhea Anastas: You also seem to be very interested in how all sorts of information that may not be directly communicated or made reference to&#151;how details, detailing&#151;is handled and played out through social behavior.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;a specific context&#151;your trip with Meghan, let&rsquo;s say. What&rsquo;s possible to&nbsp;be communicated&nbsp;within the parameters of that&nbsp;time spent together? What&nbsp;can boundaries contain or restrain, what can they allow to be put out corporeally? </p>
<p>I wonder, what are the cues for the viewer?&nbsp;And what was your&nbsp;actual&nbsp;process of structuring this&nbsp;within the performances? Did you have a way of trying to get this detailing out of the interactions and the photographing that accompanied them? </p>
<p>Leigh Ledare: <em>Double Bind</em>&rsquo;s script orders the performances, but it also opens the installation, introducing a set of parameters for viewing and focusing the viewer on what to pay attention to. The question of difference raised by the comparative structure is key. First, as a response to an observed dynamic, I created the script. This was an abstract model&#151;a system that the subjective parts, the participants in the project,&nbsp;were then submitted to. The actions of the specific participants, including mine, fleshed out the script.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;at the initial level, this&nbsp;was about an ordering of the complexity of the environment. This structuring created the conditions for the internal complexity that&nbsp;plays out interrelationally&#151;at the level of&nbsp;the individual participants&rsquo;&nbsp;agency,&nbsp;at the psychosocial level. The script functions as a kind of container. It&rsquo;s a framing&#151;not unlike that of the camera, but on an interrelational scale that allows for a recording&nbsp;and mapping&nbsp;of these cross-reflective&nbsp;dynamics.</p>
<p>Anastas: In viewing I hold an open place for all this detailing of what can&rsquo;t be stated, of the performances and the internal complications within each scenario, and how some of this crosses from one situation into the other. The photographs suggest that a cataloguing of these worlds of privacy could be taking place. But the indexical can&rsquo;t actually do this, nor can the relationships between each couple. I am left with the sense, as you just put it, of what to pay attention to, what kinds of experience, but my attention is in a strange way overloaded on a sensory level, and at the same time disappointed, because I can&rsquo;t get to this experience, I can&rsquo;t see it&#151;and the participants&rsquo; experience is parallel, they can and can&rsquo;t get to it, too. In <em>Double Bind</em> something extremely subjective turns around and looks at times to be highly objective. It conjures the discourse of the archive, the objectification of daily life, but here, in <em>Double Bind</em>&rsquo;s so-called archive, the capturing of affect and encounters would always be that which fills in this objectification, and that which is missing from it.</p>
<p>Ledare: That&rsquo;s partly what I mean by emphasizing that <em>Double Bind</em>&rsquo;s meaning hinges on this projective space.</p>
<p>Anastas:&nbsp;Will you read the project description? </p>
<p>Ledare: It reads:&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Double Bind</em>. Convince my ex-wife to go alone with me for three nights to a remote cabin, upstate NY. Married for five years, but now divorced for five years. She agrees, but gets remarried before we leave. I stay with her and photograph her over the course of the four days. This results in roughly 500 images. We sleep in different beds. Most time we&rsquo;ve spent together in five years. Two months later, pay for Meghan to return with current husband to the same cabin. Three nights again. He also happens to be a photographer. Photographs her for four days, brings me fourteen rolls of unprocessed film. I process and print all 1,000 photographs over the course of the next ten days. This results in two sets of images. My images of my ex-wife appear on black; his images of his new wife appear on white. This makes up the first comparative structure. The two sets of photographs are then positioned against a collection of media images and other ephemera. This makes up the second comparative structure.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Anastas: So the main contours of the comparative structures, the two overlapping ones, are introduced: the first, the triangle created through the recording of the two relationships; and the second having to do with the cross-reading of these private images of Meghan with the juxtaposed public images from the media collection. </p>
<p>Ledare: These problematics don&rsquo;t simply originate with my constructing the script though&#151;it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;rematerialization&nbsp;and description of dynamics that&nbsp;preexist it, and which are contemporaneous and intertwined with culture, right?&nbsp;Such dynamics are already overwhelmingly present in the collection of media materials. </p>
<p>Anastas: But the text&#151;it&rsquo;s not entirely straightforward, is it? You&rsquo;re using a voice, and one of the things that you do in the course of the script is to share a certain amount of information that&rsquo;s autobiographica<a name="_msoanchor_3">l</a> &#151;it is offered as such, within the narrative voice anyway. Even so, I don&rsquo;t know where exactly to place that voice, how to read the telling: autobiographical and distilled down, conceptualist in some sense. </p>
<p>There are a few areas of heavily-marked redactions in the writing in the project description. The reader is reminded of how much she doesn&rsquo;t know, and of what is visible and invisible. </p>
<p>Another thing that you do is gesture in a really condensed way toward fantasy construction. Since only a few details appear, they command a certain attention, such as&nbsp;&ldquo;convince my ex-wife,&rdquo; and &ldquo;she agrees, but gets remarried before we leave,&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&ldquo;we sleep in different beds.&rdquo; [&#133;] </p>
