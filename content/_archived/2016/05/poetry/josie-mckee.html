Body</p>
<br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
The body of a nude
  woman, lying in a ruined
  building.&nbsp; A body in 
  a frantic surrounding
  in motionlessness.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
An event continues
  with a body in it.
  A scene of a fallen building,
  next to a sky
  as back drop.
  The sky casts a memory
  of their unity
  when the building had both
  interior and exterior
  strong.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
She could
  walk through the ruins,
  and so doing, replace
  the sky 
  with her body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="line-height:2em;">
Stranger</p>
<br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
A loving woman
  walks diagonally across
  the sidewalk to cross.
  She makes a gesture
  of herself to cross, catches
  my eye, and motions
  to me with distant eyes &#150; I&rsquo;m someone else.
  She loves me there.
  She moves with
  a love that won&rsquo;t leave.
  Yet, her atmosphere is
  mine &#150; the same grays
  with sparks of light.</p>

Writing About Photographs</p>
<br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
I loved you before, and I love you still.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
The books I&rsquo;ve read about suicide
  have helped me to understand photography.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Our placemats lay
  under plates of scrambled eggs
  and toast with tiny chopped onions.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
We pull back chairs &amp; we sit
  to eat. You
  can never be a photograph</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
if you are inside the moment,
  chair pulled back,
  eggs,
  sitting.
  A photograph is <u>at</u>
  like a television,
  a computer screen,
  a movie,
  or a mother sometimes.
  Look at my poem, or sit down.</p>

<p style="line-height:2em;">
The Cold Way</p>
<br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
A sideways stare,
  Cold to start with.
  This corporate world
  every inch allowed to be inhuman. 
  <em>Not</em> human is <u>good</u>.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Long ago in the cave 
  it was learned
  that cold was the way 
  out of the house. 
  Fight &lsquo;em &amp; beat &lsquo;em to be out there.</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
We&rsquo;re still 
  awfully in the shade, 
  calling to other trees 
  for a coat. We are 
  shoved back 
  pulled forward somehow.
  Tough is cool &#150; 
  the rock star looks away.</p>
