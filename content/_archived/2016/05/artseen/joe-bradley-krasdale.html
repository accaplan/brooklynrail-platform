<p>Granted with infancy&rsquo;s cradle of subconscious mojo,<br/>
Moon eclipsing the sun while winking at the children,
He needs only the essentials: sleep, air, and his dreams&#150;
The things that refer to the eternal.</p>
<p>
An unpredictable impulse threatens to throw 
<span style="margin-left:185px;">Everything off balance.</span></p>
<p>
Except for the <em>Bishop</em>, who has just in time delivered
Two bold gestures, of an orator on a cropped chessboard in buff.
Puffing off-beat rhythms on one or two hoodo moon cakes 
To celebrate the dead in bright sunlight right at the edge
<span style="margin-left:185px;">Of a steep, perpendicular slope.</span></p>
<p>
Uneven patina of a black field is there to cool down
The vibrant blue sector above eye-level.
Movements are sparse here, for the sake of minimal intervention,
Vertical anatomy, horizontal emergence, infrequent handshakes;
Time educes random marks, slips of beauty.
Innocence no more, or only while the speed is beyond the limit.</p>
<p>
Patched highways with endless wheels that go at different tempos.
Below the many moons, racing to infinite regions of unsettled dreams,
Thick, fatty oil emulsions, helio-pink, dry ever slowly.
Stitched by beams of light
Inclined to break through the cracks of every sidewalk downtown.
<em>Day World</em>, <em>Mother and Child</em>, kins, scrap away all fear:
<span style="margin-left:185px;">Let them walk in their waking state.</span>
<span style="margin-left:185px;">Driving with eyes closed.</span></p>
<p>
Be a still life with a face
An over sized light bulb on a pedestal. 
A television cast in bronze
That relentlessly feeds a nightmare to a nude, an expelled 
<span style="margin-left:185px;">Adam&#151;Masaccio&rsquo;s&#151;ajolt.</span>
Though reclining, his hands and legs signal stop. 
Look, lean, jump, caressing bird, wheels, donuts, bathtub,
A portrait of a bird, letters, stamps, insects, a walking baby.
He seems to be determined to be on his own.
Good morning <em>Baba</em>.</p></div>
