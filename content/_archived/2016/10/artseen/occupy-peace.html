<p>
<em>Vested Spirit</em> anchors,
<em>Scudder Flip </em>floats.
Skins, fragile yet resilient, caress,
Stretch, wrap, suspend,
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Covered with <em>Attitude</em>.</span>
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Constant airflow underneath </span>
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Generates warmth above&#151;</span>
Some are kites flying high in the autumn sky,
Others are lanterns lit in celebration of Vedic Sanskrit.
Thin-skinned leaf, lymphatic vessels,
Lukewarm, twisted and turned,
Shedding reptile skin, transporting nutrients,
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Bent gently at a particular speed, </span>
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Bleached by desert blaze, </span>
<em>Feminine Fork</em>, <em>Hinged Fern</em>, <em>Fan Farinade</em>, <em>Woopee</em>
Were made with resolute tenacity and pleasure.</p>

<p>
In every instance, the language of action is 
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Effortlessly spelled out.</span>
The A-B-C of tactile transference manifests 
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Unmitigated exuberance.</span>
Her landmark glitter sparkles the <em>Sparkle Devil</em>.
Soaring rhythm, morning stars,
Flying mushrooms, <em>Sparkle Flag Fern</em>, chicken wire,
Dividing colors, <em>Magic Growth</em>, or <em>Something Else</em>.
Trembling vocals, orchestrated symphony, all channeling
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Sappho&rsquo;s lyrical aptitude.</span>
It is <em>The Catalogue of Women</em> that made Hesiod immortal.
Cosmogony is seen in the sacred stone.
<em>Elephant Necklace</em> bestows the flame of eternal fire.</p>

<p>
Without elevation, melted by the sun,
She leans regally against the wall and ever so gently
<span style="margin-left:230px;">Touches the shiny floor.</span>
The <em>Winged Victory of Samothrace</em> is folded once and for all.
In the near distance, the Battle of Salamis is still echoing.
But here she emphatically follows her civil disobedience.
<span style="margin-left:230px;">War no more.</span></p>
