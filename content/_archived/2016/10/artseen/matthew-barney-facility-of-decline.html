<p align="center">GLADSTONE GALLERY | SEPTEMBER 9 &#150; OCTOBER 22, 2016</p>
<p>In a photograph from 1899, a twenty-five-year-old Houdini looks toward the camera with a calm but teasing smile. He is naked save for a loincloth, and his body is trussed with chains weighted by padlocks. The manacles snake around his neck, arms, and feet, pulling him forward into a bow. To the right is a picture of Jim Otto, the 256-pound Raiders player who underwent so many surgeries due to his football career (seventy-four in total) that he should have been fast-tracked for a medical license in orthopedics. He has a Cro-Magnon superciliary arch and holds his Raiders helmet aloft like the head of a decapitated victim. Juxtaposed in the introductory pages of <em>OTTO Trilogy&#151;</em>the catalogue that accompanies Matthew Barney&rsquo;s current exhibition at Gladstone Gallery&#151;the two are in cosmic tension.</p>

!!img1!!

<p>If the two are Barney&rsquo;s mythical deities, their gallery is the universe. In <em>Repressia</em> (1991), bone-white plastic anchors form tracks along the ceiling above an expansive wrestling mat. In <em>Transexualis</em> (1991), a walk-in cooler houses a cast petroleum jelly decline bench. These and other sculptures on view, most from 1991, are perplexing in the same way that the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway must have been before the invention of explanatory myths. Video performances, looped on televisions throughout the gallery, provide
  that mythology.</p>
<p>In <em>OTTOblow </em>(1991)<em>,</em> Otto (played by Bob Wysocki) charges forward in his black Raiders jersey toward Houdini (played by Barney). Mid-sprint, Otto forms a fist, preparing to strike. Houdini&rsquo;s nude abdomen flexes in anticipation before the thick piston of Otto&rsquo;s forearm drives into it. Houdini suffered a similar punch in 1926 and died days later in a Detroit hospital. In <em>OTTOblow</em>, however, Otto starts what resembles a healing ritual; he traces Houdini&rsquo;s petroleum jelly-caked abdomen, settling on the navel and fingering it. However violent their rivalry, they are like all great antagonists: codependent, mutually constituted. </p>
<p>Even as the exhibition&rsquo;s videos contextualize certain sculptures, others gain their force through direct physical presence. <em>DRILL TEAM: screw BOLUS </em>(1991) splays across the gallery floor like a giant squid. A barbell is loaded with eight forty-five-pound York-brand weights, all cast in the analgesic cream Cramergesic. A flesh-colored prosthetic-plastic locker is flattened beneath it; a gel pack traces the outline of the work recalling a hospital IV, and Otto&rsquo;s black-and-white home and away jerseys, piled in the work&rsquo;s center, confirm its subject. It&rsquo;s a monument to Otto&rsquo;s ambition and force (the barbell would total 405 pounds if it was cast iron and not analgesic cream), even as it&rsquo;s a haunting reminder of the harrowing physical consequences of that kind of self-denial. The work uses uncanny materials that have profound impacts on anatomy&#151;as substitutes for limbs or joints, as salves&#151;in ways that simultaneously preserve and undermine the very identities of our bodies.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, vaginal specula and sternal retractors open various artificial tissues, like that of the polymer wrestling mat in <em>Repressia</em>. In a film related to the sculpture, Otto and Houdini reenact the motions of the snap between the football center and quarterback respectively. In typical Barney fashion, the video moves to a faux pearl issuing from a vagina and landing in the aforementioned sternal retractor. In an oneiric turn, an orange clay disc shatters against the woman&rsquo;s (Houdini&rsquo;s) buttocks, imitating the issuing of a penalty flag in football. </p>
<p>Barney&rsquo;s focus on orifices, on materials that become flesh, on human activities and human beings metamorphosing into psychosexual abstractions makes his work particularly handy for those with a penchant for gender theory or psychoanalysis. Maggie Nelson, whose essay &ldquo;On Porousness, Perversity, and Pharmacopornographia&rdquo; appears in the <em>OTTO Trilogy </em>catalogue, brilliantly integrates Angela Carter&rsquo;s remarks about pornography&rsquo;s tendency to abstract things to the &ldquo;probe and the fringed hole,&rdquo; or Leo Bersani&rsquo;s observations about homophobia during the AIDS crisis feeding on the &ldquo;intolerable image of a grown man, legs high in the air, unable to refuse the suicidal ecstasy of being a woman.&rdquo; Nelson mentions that Barney discovered the writer J.G. Ballard around the time he discovered Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, a Freudian who argued that &ldquo;regression to the anal-sadistic phase eroded differences between the sexes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The relationship between Barney&rsquo;s work and many of these thinkers is undeniable&#151;&ldquo;required reading&rdquo;&#151;as Nelson put it, but shifting focus to writers like J.G. Ballard offers considerable insight into the comic modes in which Barney&rsquo;s work sometimes operates. In his essay &ldquo;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan,&rdquo; Ballard slips into the same obscene surrealism as Barney. The essay is framed as a report from an experiment wherein patients are asked to &ldquo;construct the optimum auto disaster victim by placing a replica of Reagan&rsquo;s head on the unretouched photographs of crash fatalities.&rdquo; Like Barney, Ballard is expert at stretching a narrative thread to its breaking point. The study is chaotic, nonsensical: Reagan&rsquo;s &ldquo;facial tones and musculature&rdquo; are characteristic of &ldquo;homoerotic behavior,&rdquo; intercourse with &ldquo;Reagan&rdquo; using &ldquo;assembly kit photographs&rdquo; was &ldquo;uniformly disappointing&rdquo; if vaginal, but increasingly successful in &ldquo;auxiliary, buccal, navel, aural, and orbital modes.&rdquo; At first, the essay seems like an excuse to poke fun at Reagan&#151;&ldquo;65% of male subjects made positive connections between [his] hairstyle and their own pubic hair&rdquo;&#151;but it accumulates a peculiar plausibility. Ballard creates a phantasmagoric American car crash of dark psychological experiment, sublimated sexual fantasy, politics, and celebrity. </p>
<p>Gladstone&rsquo;s press release makes a point of emphasizing that the exhibition is not a repetition of the show of his early work, but a mirror for it. Indeed, viewing the work there, now, comes with a sense of dramatic irony; we know what comes next. Nonetheless, these early works hone in on some of Barney&rsquo;s densest and most poetic ideas. </p>
