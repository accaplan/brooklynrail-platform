 <p>
Swayed by summer breeze, tinted with transparent ocher, punctured 
<span style="margin-left:260px;">Asymmetrically with alluring violence, </span>
Symmetrically piercing the other side at will,
Swirling slowly to another unknown space below.
Some of us are reminded of the
<span style="margin-left:260px;">Exposed torso of Saint Sebastian.</span>
This is how I see from this bird&rsquo;s eye view of his unsowed landscapes.</p>

<p>
A few miles down the road, a <em>chartreuse </em>diamond for Mondrian 
And William Burroughs, to play a sideways game of golf with thirty-six holes, 
Suspended three inches from the wall&#151;
<span style="margin-left:260px;">I&rsquo;m obsessed with the invisible five.</span>
I&rsquo;ve also seen a snowflake, or cake frosting in one configuration&#151;
<span style="margin-left:260px;">It was strange and weirdly familiar!</span></p>

<p>
Around the corner, nuts and bolts boisterously fortify 
A sign board apparatus with bent nails 
<span style="margin-left:260px;">Dancing to their own rhythm.</span>
In this neck of the woods, they celebrate cornfield shooting.
Erotic beauty meanwhile exudes from someone&rsquo;s lower abdomen,
A relaxed yet formidable part of another body.</p>

<p>
A celestial body, torrential flow of silky sky into the familiar night.
Democracy at our specific moment prompts the
Haunting desire and something indescribable!
<em>excavation</em> melts, surrenders to the mood of a lazy Sunday afternoon.
Butterscotch candy, naked lunch, caramel cream cake,
<span style="margin-left:260px;"><em>Last Year at Marienbad</em>, <em>Paris, Texas</em>, etc.</span></p>

<p>
It is hard to find one&rsquo;s way through <em>fallow field, amber</em>.
<em>fallow fields, blue 2</em>, a target bombing, downpour like
Operation Rolling Thunder. How can I forget!</p>

<p>
<em>flowers shot</em>, seen through a window, glazed with zine white.
The point of convergence is the sublimity of violence
That echos Gran Fury.</p>

<p>
Nearby, a hound dog guards the second signpost of
<em>cobalt and pecans</em> in place of <em>Home for Sale</em> signage.
One can&rsquo;t simply look through the holes 
And declare what is durable or what might break.
The vertical vista of an all-over volcanic rupture,
Or the element of contrast in <em>moss green</em>,
Or <em>fallow field and farmhouse,</em>
With perspective or without,
The constituents of the mass ornament reveal a vanishing point.
<span style="margin-left:260px;">Yippie yi ooh! Yippie yi yay!</span></p>
