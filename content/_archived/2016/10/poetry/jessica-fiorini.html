awkward pose as award year
  raising the bar to medium
  mediocre podium middle career
  cat nap in an abandoned fridge
  anger as subtle as a broken child
  screaming out a sniper&rsquo;s space
  I won&rsquo;t give that rage a name
  slippery platform dump to past due
  would you feed the meter on that babe?
  social feed featuring first day of school
  passive comments aggressively angled
  (ok fine. it was cute.)
  turn it down a notch, would you dear?
  your photostream is a highly edited work
  the official policy on nipples 
  is flush this quarter
  two whole new channels 
  dedicated to body politics 
  gist being 
  that nipples are more than body
  and are just asking for it
  do you know what they do with those things?
  chat that red flag commentator
  keep the parasites afloat running
  hit counts and bast worship
  news cycle just about keeps up
  rheumatic and crippled to join flynt
  a kingdom of exploitation and manipulation
  damn 
  he called&nbsp; your hand
  that must burn worse yet
  are you ashamed to say goodbye?
  that&rsquo;s your white promise 
  gasping in retreat 
  it&rsquo;s light out chappie
  for your understanding of culture
  is flat jack up on this affront
  he&rsquo;s not a billboard
  he&rsquo;s your brother
  married off to that nice cynthia girl
  before she found out his viewing distance
  cross county there he stands
  a beacon of recruitment 
  have a beer
  have a girl
  have my girl
  hey, jus kiddin
  ain&rsquo;t I baby?
  billboard brother says
  others had it better before you
  and god forbid
  someone has it better after you
  message to overgrow and underpass
  third rate skinny dipping (just as friends)
  traveling long distances for hopes
  in a supremely uncomfortable ride
  confusing my friends
  as recipients of dick pics
  I shit you not
  people of the future
  are a real phenomenon
  that nobody asks for
  and yet here we are
  in a poem
  spending valuable time
  on how uneducated we are
  in sex, gender, decay and pleasure
  so disappointing
  you able bodies
  you throbbed constellations 
  lounging lazily without checking
  screen for departures
  you there
  useless dude
  stop messing with my friends
  you there
  oppressive den mother
  stop messing with my friends
  you there
  manipulative egotists
  stop messing with my friends </p>
<p align="right">
shaken sugar packet fallen to foam
  loud couple agree on the concept of respect
  you know what I mean
  there&rsquo;s always a thing between us
  a rain thing that hides interloped
  throat makes all conversation
  louder and more gunfire laugh
  that is siren not enjoyment
  flee the coral cut edge
  that guy has you fooled
  oh yeah oh yeah
  lady you better stay away
  oh yeah oh yeah</p>

worship arrives on air current 
  a missive strikes
  me this it&rsquo;s me it&rsquo;s me
  rings a hidden exit experiment&nbsp; 
  vibe rallies the horn section 
  so baby alright baby
  so don&rsquo;t be uptight 
  break your back 
  eye the escape
  the fire last time we spoke 
  was tongues and glances </p>
<p align="right">
missing interdependency replacing open door
  exits are all about horizon 
  or not but usually true 
  direction isn&rsquo;t just a concept 
  we doctor the word
  on currents now blown 
  to the worn burgundy rug
  the only thing that survived 
  is a language we don&rsquo;t need to understand</p>

<em>Internal Geography</em> </p>

  equatorial line sluices the rose bud
  above and below the temperature drifts
  in and out a species trigger upon collision 
  meridian clause to the loving element
  notched beaks peck the time twine
  strings together a lack of new vocabulary
  the backyard that proceeds us
  seats us among the crabapple
  champagne grass bubbles out a breeze
  echo canyon soundtrack trekked a haunting
  through memorized rifts it&rsquo;s all one band
  that finger plays a charmed fool
  playhouse matinee to matinee 
  theatre to cabaret same stage 
  different wish different hour 
  and it&rsquo;s in my chest
  lift systems set mechanics belief
  system fantasy engine drachma tout
  fort metal stone flesh bone carbon
  copy ration brain trout up stream
  dying spawning swimming
  hidden inverse space doughnut 
  inedible in life but who knows 
  death better than a woman
  knows life cheap shot acknowledged
  I&rsquo;m sure it means something clever
  even if &ldquo;it&rdquo; is undefined and untenable
  thought electric pissing through a system</p>

  addressing my melancholy by national review
  model recurrence of good ally across 
  holding back that toe to dip into power
  sugar cane turn to molasses my friends
  are treated as less than a bushel economy
  harvest moon armor attention that goes forever
  human code the existence for futile meditation
  fire in the hole of yosemite&rsquo;s eye field
  heat traits in surface tension to think
  that we are clandestine units of predictable
  motion close it out and spread the gas masks
  forward is just backward once again
  we forget how to parse the important stuff
  me you him her all gasping terminals
  letting the algorithm dictate opinion option
  the view just one paddock of the news market
  supposedly we&rsquo;re more connected than ever
  to the stuttering desires of suffering
  now drown under the bankroll and thread control
  a woman throws the canister back to the cops </p>
