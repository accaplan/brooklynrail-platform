<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m waiting for the bus and imagine the street is made 
  of money, but it&rsquo;s not the type of money accepted on this 
  planet or any planet. Sometimes I&rsquo;m waiting for the bus 
  and I see the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; projected on people&rsquo;s faces, but 
  not my own. I am no longer new.&nbsp; What are you if you 
  aren&rsquo;t new? The bus is on the left side, and I am on the right. 
  I am waiting for the bus, but I am only wearing my Underroos 
  and my stuffed cat can&rsquo;t get on the bus because she doesn&rsquo;t 
  have a MetroCard, and I am trying to pay the fare with a wallet 
  full of pigeon blood. It multiplies as it spills through the center 
  lane of the empty bus, foaming mouths at the edges of 
  bloody waves.&nbsp; My clones wear animal masks: lions, flamingo,
  toad, while we wait for the bus. The bus is inside my skin 
  riding my spine. None of us are small enough to get inside it. 
  I don&rsquo;t care where the bus is going anymore, but I want to be on it. 
  Have you ever kissed an august Buddha in the marsupial pouch 
  of a bus? It feels like being the soul of oatmeal, but better. 
  Everyone I have ever loved is on that bus. They are going to 
  a protest, but nobody remembers what the issue is, or the issue 
  keeps changing like the words on the signs:&nbsp; the name of 
  the candidate or the name of the war.&nbsp; We are going 
  to the march because we want to be together, but aren&rsquo;t 
  together.&nbsp; We are waiting for different buses that don&rsquo;t arrive. 
  We are waiting for a bus from inside an iceberg, and before we can 
  get on the bus, the icebergs have to melt. We want them to melt 
  because we haven&rsquo;t had sex in 24 and a half days, or because 
  we like to eat grass-fed lamb burgers in the back of a rhinestone 
  stretch limousine that circles Alaska before we can even find 
  the bus stop. It&rsquo;s possible I fell asleep and we are all melting 
  icebergs waiting for the bus, flooding Foster Avenue with salt water 
  and half-frozen chunks of displaced whale spirits. One day I am waiting 
  so long for the bus that I forget that I am waiting for a bus, and find 
  myself inventing music, dairy-free b&eacute;chamel and urban tetherball. 
  They crown me the biggest shark in the biggest city of the universe, 
  and I am on every TV channel, big toothed grinning like I&rsquo;m the host 
  or something, but nobody watches tv anymore. Everyone would 
  rather be writing post-linguistic poetry or studying artisanal 
  adzuki bean canning. If a woman smiles on a TV set and nobody 
  watches yadda yadda, you know. So, I go back to my bus stop, 
  remember I should have been waiting for the bus. I enjoy waiting 
  for busses. I&rsquo;m a bus waiter. There&rsquo;s beauty in waiting for the bus.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">The Adjunct Commuter&#151;A Cento </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Over the shrill echoes, 
  I saw the bus.</p>
<p>
Now-ness and then-ness. 
  <span style="margin-left:50px;">A thud. A thump.</span> </p>
<p>
Out of the ruins of the clock: 
  a freight train in your chest, 
  giddy mishaps of blackness. </p>
<p>
Submission to the submachine,
  the wind&rsquo;s dramatic flesh.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Air in Air. I clomp clomp. </p>
<p>
Wheels are inside me thundering. 
  Minutes shine at the tips of branches. </p>
<p>
Hair caught on a bus thrown back&nbsp; </p>
<p>
At the edge of the world, silent flashes 
  escaping from time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The wind cries like a wounded animal.
  A bird&rsquo;s metallic voice </p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">So what about those many</span> 
  sheets of drifting time? </p>
<p>
The caravans left.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The traffic signal sways.</p>
<p>
Through the chambers of the eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the street&rsquo;s beaten gray. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air sped by. </p>
<p>
A south wind carrying fangs, sunflowers, 
  alphabets.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The red minute waits. 
  Green just lies there awhile breathing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Everything comes bearing a new name.
  I see daylight take off running. </p>
<p>
Face to the wind&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

Kerosene</span>
  (after Frank O&rsquo;Hara)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Ah drone butterflies
  when you think of them
  dropping polished 
  &ldquo;like&rdquo; buttons 
  in hologram stork mouths
  you know how wonderful 
  the 21st century
  can be
  and the gilded teeth marks
  on the monitors 
  invisible and historic buzzes
  clothed in data
  slightly jelloy
  like a Mike Kelley </p>
<p>
there is the mystery of loss
  somewhere inside
  our fingers pause
  we invented this era
  with our flying
  which is blue and pillowy</p>
<p>
we owe a debt to 
  our wires and to Mark Zuckerberg
  for playing scrabble 
  in our lungs
  before we were born</p>
<p>
we don&rsquo;t do much ourselves,
  but click and chew
  write emails
  to our kinder
  doppelgangers
  who are waiting 
  for the retweets to arrive
  and who else cries
  it is our habit
  to obscure</p>
<p>
how are you living 
  in broken December
  I am angry like a cupcake 
  in an &eacute;clair factory</p>
<p>
How dare you
  you were
  made in the shape
  of our demographic
  I was not
  I was made between
  the wings of a drone canary 
  &ldquo;with an surgical strike carved 
  from nostalgia&rdquo; 
  except for fear (just listen)
  I am in love with this century
  for being so complicated
  but still I have to weep</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Being in a funk&rdquo; is what the cool people call it. </p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s the purple that surrounds the scene at the lake. 
  Not sad enough to actually drown. </p>
<p>
You say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a funk&rdquo; and I think you think 
  you&rsquo;re too pretty, too well groomed, 
  too stylishly disheveled, to actually sulk.</p>
<p>
Have you ever tried drinking a milkshake 
  with a girlfriend in a funk?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
She just stares at the straw as if sucking on it 
  would allow the whole world into her mouth. </p>
<p>
When a teenager wears baggy sweatpants 
  all February, her math teacher may ask her 
  if she&rsquo;s in a funk. </p>
<p>
(She&rsquo;s actually just pissed off.)</p>
<p>
Frogs don&rsquo;t get into funks 
  but toads do. </p>
<p>
In the Bible, Abraham thought Sarah was in a funk, 
  but she was actually shaking with grief.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
When her baby arrived, her 100 year old flesh 
  quivered like a sliced papaya.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
There is nothing funky 
  about being in a funk.</p>
<p>
The Polish biochemist Casimir Funk
  invented vitamins. </p>
<p>
The golfer Fred Funk wore a ruffled skirt 
  to settle a bet with Annika Sorenstam</p>
<p>
Doing cartwheels or changing the bed sheets 
  are suggested cures for getting out of a funk.</p>
<p>
To be in a funk is to want to cry,
  but to be unable to access tears.</p>
<p>
To be in a funk is to be unable to hear
  the music in the subway&rsquo;s rattle. </p>
<p>
If Virginia Woolf had been in a funk,
  she would have filled her pockets 
  with dead lilacs, instead of rocks.&nbsp; </p>
