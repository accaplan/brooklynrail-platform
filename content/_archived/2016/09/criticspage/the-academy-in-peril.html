<p>I undertake my philosophical endeavors outside the university. As everyone knows, philosophy has for two centuries been the university&rsquo;s private game preserve, and that, except for a mere dozen names, all philosophers of note have been professors: that is, civil servants. Philosophy since Kant has essentially become philosophical commentary, the philosophy of philosophy. It has since then addressed no one but philosophers themselves, in what I call the modern esotericism of philosophy. Only recently have I realized that now, for the first time since Marx and Nietzsche, it is possible to break from modern philosophy&rsquo;s esoteric style and once more propose, <em>exoterically</em>, a complete philosophical system. <em>Transgression and the Inexistent</em>, published in English, lays out the premises for just such a departure from esotericism, which I will be completing over the next two years.</p>
<p>The second way I include myself by exclusion in the contemporary landscape and exclude myself by inclusion from it has to do with my position on two thinkers behind the most remarkable philosophical &ldquo;Revolution&rdquo; of the past few decades (the &ldquo;speculative turn&rdquo;): Badiou and Meillassoux. </p>
<p>As much as anyone else, I feel the influence of the philosophies associated with these two names, but here again I find myself in the countercurrent. What the &ldquo;speculative realists&rdquo; and other &ldquo;new realists&rdquo; have retained of Meillassoux&rsquo;s contribution is, first of all, its &ldquo;anti-correlationism,&rdquo; which allows them to &ldquo;return to things in themselves.&rdquo; That is, to produce &ldquo;positive ontologies.&rdquo; For me &ldquo;anti-correlationism&rdquo; is a brilliant but somewhat secondary demonstration by comparison with Meillassoux&rsquo;s true revolution in the history of philosophy: the demonstration of the necessity of contingence. And it is precisely upon this revolution that I, unlike the tenants of &ldquo;ontological realisms,&rdquo; base my own endeavor, though from this metaphysical &ldquo;basis&rdquo; of the absolute contingency of all things I draw wholly different consequences from those of Meillassoux himself.</p>
<p>It is, of course, to Badiou and not to Meillassoux, that we owe the true &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; impulse behind the &ldquo;anti-correlational&rdquo; return to &ldquo;ontological realism.&rdquo; Not only did he allow all the rising names of the contemporary landscape to return to &ldquo;ontological na&iuml;vet&eacute;,&rdquo; despite two centuries of correlational ontologies (Hegel, Husserl, Deleuze) and especially of ontological critique (Kant, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, et al.), but all of these ontologies are <em>derived </em>fromBadiou. This is true of Garcia&rsquo;s thing-oriented set-theorism, of Harman&rsquo;s object-oriented correlationism, of Gabriel&rsquo;s &ldquo;The world does not exist &ldquo; (which is what Badiou&rsquo;s two magnum opuses had demonstrated), of Brassier&rsquo;s &ldquo;ontological nihilism,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Here again, exclusive inclusion and inclusive exclusion. Somewhat as with Meillassoux, I retain from Badiou what almost no one else retains, and reject out of hand absolutely everything, whether &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; or &ldquo;elitist,&rdquo; that others seem to swallow, no questions asked. In terms of the mainstream I reject out of hand everything that Badiou means to &ldquo;propose&rdquo; to humanity in terms of political and ethical &ldquo;destiny.&rdquo; The same goes for his views on sexual ethics and art. The &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; material is, of course, the ontological <em>revival</em>, which has spawned so many imitators. I have, however, <em>demonstrated</em> that the hypothesized strict equivalence between ontology and mathematics is quite simply <em>false</em>. I have especially shown that <em>if </em>mathematics were not ontology, then <em>no ontology whatsoever would be possible.</em> This could not be further from the conclusions of all the &ldquo;new realisms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I retain from Badiou the most important thing, to which no one yet has paid any heed: his concept of truth, the most substantial such concept to appear in philosophy since Heidegger. But I make wholly different use of it, and for good reason: my work has long consisted of a rigorous deconstruction of <em>all </em>of Badiou&rsquo;s great constructions. This deconstruction, however, has not led to pure and simple destruction, compelling us to wade forever more through a bog of conceptual ruins (the great Heidegger-Derrida axis). Rather, it has led specifically to a systematic reconstruction: to a new system, which owes nothing to the deconstruction on which it was erected.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Badiou-Meillassoux impetus, many a philosopher in the current landscape has laid claim to the term &ldquo;system&rdquo;&#151;erroneously, to my eye, in most, if not all, cases. It seems to me that a philosophical system must meet at least two criteria: (1) all of its elements must be logically linked, and account for one another with complete coherence no matter where we start our examination; (2) it must take an entirely new perspective on <em>all</em> anthropological, techno-scientific, erotic, aesthetic, ethico-political, legislative-transgressive experience. None of today&rsquo;s self-proclaimed &ldquo;systems&rdquo; meet these criteria, and it is from this impasse that my work seeks to emerge. So far it has managed to emerge esoterically; soon, I hope, it will emerge exoterically as well. </p>
