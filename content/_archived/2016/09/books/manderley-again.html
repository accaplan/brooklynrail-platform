Gina Wohlsdorf
<em>Security</em>
(Algonquin Press, 2016)</strong></p>

<p>Gina Wohlsdorf&rsquo;s <em>Security</em> contains at least two major stories, and while one of them is a fairly sweet love story about wounded folks who manage to find each other and their way, the other one is so unbelievably terrifying and fraught that it&rsquo;s actually easy to overlook, or certainly attempt to speed through, the sweeter parts of this novel.</p>
!!img1!!
<p>To be clear: this novel kept me from sleep. Not merely because I was reading it well into dark, but because, once I set the book down, I was scared to close my eyes. I don&rsquo;t handle scary-movie fear well, and <em>Security</em>&rsquo;s scary-movie fear is monumental, insistent, borderline profound. The novel itself: there&rsquo;s a hotel, the Manderley, that&rsquo;s about to open on the California coast and was made to be the sort of ultra-luxe place where &ldquo;a movie star [could] sojourn from a bad breakup&rdquo; and &ldquo;the hedge fund manager [will know] discretion will be afforded his mistress.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s being built by Charles Destin, whose own father was killed in a hotel by a cheap bomb, the details of which function almost entirely as a hook on which an aspect of the story hangs: <em>Security</em> opens cinematically, like a camera panning, following characters as they cross a screen, and there&rsquo;s such a wealth of detail at the start&#151;names, jobs, tensions, the huge maze of roses growing alongside the hotel&#151;that it&rsquo;s something of a shock to realize how quickly Wohlsdorf&rsquo;s able to zing the reader&rsquo;s attention to Tessa, the story&rsquo;s heroine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be unfair to slog hard against Tessa, even if she does come with some very familiar trappings. Single, beautiful, icy&#151;one of those tough-exterior-nougat-centered delectations most of us are familiar with. Even with the recognizable aspects, Tessa&rsquo;s still a compelling character: she works her guts out for Destin, diplomatically calming waters after he engages in one of his regular cruelties&#151;telling off underlings, firing them, etc. Tessa&rsquo;s also all but incapable of trusting anyone, of letting anyone in, having been so wounded by a past event the reader slowly gleans.</p>

<p>Actually, not all that slowly: Tessa&rsquo;s an orphan, eventually adopted by a family that already had adopted twin brothers Brian and Mitch. On page 14 Brian rides up to the Manderley on his motorcycle, kicking the story&rsquo;s emotional momentum into gear. Brian is a stunt motorcycle rider, the remaining half of a pair of Evel Knievels, the Domini Twins, the other half being his twin brother Mitch, now dead. Brian and Tessa haven&rsquo;t seen each other for years and years, last having interacted as Tessa begged Brian to stop riding after Mitch missed a jump, killing himself in the process. I can happily admit here that as a reviewer I&rsquo;d love to tell you why Brian returned to Tessa this particular night, but I not only can&rsquo;t remember the <em>why</em> but, when reading the book, didn&rsquo;t find it important.</p>
<p>This is significant to talk about, even just briefly, in a review of a book that&rsquo;s such a well-crafted trap of a reading experience. The <em>why</em> of things matters little in this book. That&rsquo;s not a dig at Wohlsdorf&#151;who, if there&rsquo;s justice, is already being well compensated for the screenplay she&rsquo;s hopefully writing right this moment. The truth is questions of <em>why</em> end up unsatisfying, anyway: think of <em>Halloween</em> or <em>Scream</em>, the two horror movies this book most resembles (the former because the killers here wear the same Shatner masks as Myers does; the latter because of the pomo/self-aware/pair-of-killers aspect). The most unsatisfying parts of those movies is when the events or acts are boxed, contextualized: who gives a shit what Jason&rsquo;s youth was like, what Neve Campbell&rsquo;s mother did to the other kid&rsquo;s dad? The point of the stories is the agony of the fear and the thrill of escaping it.</p>
<p>So why is this book so terrifying? Because in this nearly-finished-but-not-quite hotel, security, as has already been mentioned, is taken real seriously. So much so that the security team has its own floor&#151;the twentieth&#151;and is staffed with former SEAL and law-enforcement types, top-of-the-line guys well-versed in aggressively neutralizing threats. This group of protectors have a baked-in level of invisibility: there&rsquo;s a secret elevator only the head of security and Charles Destin himself know about, and the security team runs drills and scenarios&#151;again, even though the hotel&rsquo;s not entirely finished&#151;to stay entirely ready for any threat. The reader&rsquo;s made to understand early on how impenetrable the hotel is, how inviolable and safe not just due to the no-bullshit security guys but because of its secrecy. Because the hotel&rsquo;s secret aspects&#151;an elevator, certain rooms only two people have keys to, override controls only available to the security team up in their twentieth floor nest&#151;create imperfect knowledge: nobody knows everything here, not Tessa, obviously not her brother Brian nor the hotel workers we meet (all of whom are well-rendered, interesting, just real enough to make you feel it when they die), not the pair of killers walking terrifyingly around destroying everyone. And the killers are&#151;like Michael Myers in <em>Halloween</em>&#151;slow but relentless, un-distractible. And what&rsquo;s interesting about the lack of an articulable&nbsp;<em>why</em>&#151;the book even addresses the lack, speculates on it&#151;is that it never allows the reader to be sure the killers have reached their goal. Ever. Is the goal Brian? Tessa? Charles Destin himself? </p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have said <em>the book</em> there: the narrator. There&rsquo;s a narrator in <em>Security</em>, and page 11 is where I can find the first giveaway: &ldquo;I almost laugh,&rdquo; it reads, about halfway down the page. <em>Ah hah</em>, the reader thinks: someone&rsquo;s behind the curtain. The question <em>by whom</em> takes a while to answer, and it&rsquo;d be cruel to dish it here, but the reveal&rsquo;s about as satisfying as it gets. Here&rsquo;s your hint: the cinematic opening, where it feels like one long PT Anderson/Scorsese single-tracking shot, is continued throughout the book. In several places, the page is split in half, or thirds, or quarters, with simultaneous narratives being given. It&rsquo;s split-screen narration, and it&rsquo;s glorious and sickening and almost impossible to pull yourself from.</p>
<p>Of note, too, is that this is a literary thriller, one of those books you don&rsquo;t have to laugh off and claim is just popcorny escapism when a friend asks what you&rsquo;re reading. Gina Wohlsdorf&rsquo;s written a stunningly propulsive and somehow moving thriller with an ending I was excited to read both because of how satisfyingly it snapped close the meticulously crafted box of the novel and because, mercifully, I was able to escape the terror of it. </p>
