<p>
How does an image transfigure?
How fast can it appear before consciousness?
Like the letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; in apple,
Knowledge is eaten, expelled, dropped, then piled up
Into a monumental muck!</p>

<p>
There, on a desolate horizon, a <em>Figure with Outstretched </em>
<em>Arms </em>cries out, what is my anomalous countenance.
Here, a specific blanket is used for 
A purpose different than
Keeping human skin and body warm at night.</p>

<p>
<em>Standart </em>asserts its own primordial presence,
Between the dance of death and the tree of life,
Why or y? Perhaps between mysticism and eroticism
There lies a double vision of every image 
We have encountered in our lives.</p>

<p>
Who&rsquo;s asking the question?
Should a <em>System Painting</em> be disguised in three capital &lsquo;A&rsquo;s
Held up in different places 
In the painting&rsquo;s own time and space?
At times some figures appear frontally
Like Christ in the tympanum of a Romanesque church
Standing in the center, nothing to hide
From his admirers, or detractors.
Other times, a few pose like the proud Moses holding 
The tablet with one hand 
While his other hand points up to the sky.</p>

<p>
Nearby, a fierce vexation of spirit bespeaks rejection
Of the establishment. It&rsquo;s a <em>Coup d&rsquo;Etat</em> of great urgency,
A transitory scene, capturing the bodies in action&#151; 
All in profile save for the intended casualty.
What crime have you, I, and they committed?
We&rsquo;re just doing what we were taught!</p>

<p>
A ferocious penchant for making new <em>Weapons;</em>
Like the primeval urge to cut, to crumble, to bundle,
To fold things into things,
To transform things into other things,
They&rsquo;re indeed unusual still-lives. 
Concurrently, <em>Spectrum</em>, <em>Primitive Computer</em> simultaneously 
Offer the artist&rsquo;s version of Jacob wrestling the angel 
In the Old Testament. It was the same day,
Same year, 1968. </p>

<p>
It was time to swim against the current.
It was time to refuse to sit in an <em>Electric Chair</em>
In three-quarters profile between <em>Heaven and Hell</em>.
Hallelujah, hallelujah!</p>
