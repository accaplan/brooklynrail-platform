<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>In the greatest scenes</u></p>
<br/>
<p>It is fairly common</p>
<p>&#151;which is to say</p>
<p>We are usually unaware</p>
<p>Of an exact moment </p>
<br/>
<p>Like this one&#151;when</p>
<p>The actor repeats himself</p>
<p>In error&#151;tho this is felt exactly </p>
<p>As particularized embodiment</p>
<br/>
<p>And it is at this and for this</p>
<p>The crowd starts laughing its loudest</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><u>Its loudest thing is history</u></p>
<br/>
<p>I lie beneath </p>
<p>So much writhing </p>
<p>In the air</p>
<p>The performativity of insects</p>
<p>I admire in lines</p>
<p>The yellow-green </p>
<p>Spoils of the newest trees</p>
<p>I have yet to name the</p>
<p>Characters or give them bells&rsquo;</p>
<p>The golden tolling </p>
<p>Of apples</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaped up&rdquo; </p>
<p>In their necks</p>
<p>Which means&#151;containment &nbsp;</p>
<p>It means masculine</p>
<p>If I could particularize</p>
<p>Or &ldquo;You make me happy,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or &ldquo;No, you make me unhappy, actually,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><u>Something is happening</u></p>
<br/>
<p>What seems plausible on the page</p>
<p>Until one of the actors speaks it</p>
<p>Then unfolds falsely&#151;and this was not the feeling</p>
<p>This set of words had</p>
<p>Meant to mean&#151;even suggesting</p>
<p>The area around non-numbers</p>
<p>Or the adding up of voices&#151;this one</p>
<p>To this one&#151;in a long chain</p>
<br/>
<p>A false song&#151;</p>
<p>The trouble is&#151;</p>
<p>Instead of acting</p>
<p>The actor stands in front of a mirror </p>
<p>Instead of standing the actor admires </p>
<br/>
<p>What is so beautiful</p>
<p>Is so perfect</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><u>Establishing shot</u></p>
<br/>
<p>There is a wind gathering in front of the building </p>
<p>Where the emergency takes place</p>
<p>All day</p>
<p>Inside me. Just the night before</p>
<p>I was in Del Ray</p>
<p>Fighting with Jesse.</p>
<p>Presumably it was about nothing</p>
<p>Though I stood outside the motel</p>
<p>As he cut across the courtyard</p>
<p>And pool&#151;and could I focus all my attention</p>
<p>Now on this empty pool</p>
<p>And lights built into the concrete sides</p>
<p>Illuminating the water from within</p>
<p>Or perhaps the shadows travel upward</p>
<p>The terrazzo walls to the parking lot behind the motel</p>
<p>And those streetlights I remember</p>
<p>How empty those spaces seemed</p>
<p>Though filled with water</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



  
<p><u>Score</u></p>
<p>I associate</p>
<p>I associate the death of Mom </p>
<p>With the only landscape</p>
<p>My observation changed</p>
<p>When the camera pulls away </p>
<p>To reveal</p>
<p>The king is Elvis and everything is passionate</p>
<p>And still alive. And my dream is dumb</p>
<p>That I am speaking to you</p>
<p>Though you have my arm</p>
<p>Twisted behind my back</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say Uncle.</p>
<p>But. Mom</p>
<p>Uncle Jesse</p>
<p>Joey.</p>
<p>Danny.</p>
<p>My parents. </p>
<p>Are missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



  
<p><u>Labor</u></p>
<p>There is the feeling that nothing can mitigate this feeling </p>
<p>Of a pulling away</p>
<p>Into space&#151;a string</p>
<p>Which we could inhabit</p>
<p>Like a pin-head</p>
<p>I think this means</p>
<p>Inadequately&#151;dance</p>
<p>Music&#151;in theory </p>
<p>What happens to us&#151;</p>
<p>Happens in slow motion&#151;</p>
<p>The head feels itself coming undone</p>
<p>So limpidly, in chunks and ribbons </p>
<p>For as long as we have</p>
<p>This idea, we come into being </p>
<p>Fresh, out of the shower, when you look</p>
<p>At the cleaned kitchen. The expensive living room</p>
<p>Rug. And what became of the other people</p>
<p>Who suffered us</p>
<p>Relative to the annual drop or rise in temperature? </p>
<p>What became</p>
<p>Of us? It is true</p>
<p>Nothing? Or it is not true? And everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what this is about. </p>
<p>At least, I think</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this says.</p>

<p><em>Ripple in an airless breeze</em></p>

<p><em>Does it mean</em></p>
<p><em>The meaningless</em></p>
<p><em>Fluttering across the true and permanent dark</em></p>
<p><em>Of space&#151;what binds our boundless</em></p>
<p><em>Plural&#151;at midnight&#151;as we&rsquo;re walking </em></p>

<p>A person posing</p>
<p>Near a window, just short of breaking </p>
<p>Off the view, or as good </p>
<p>Any new idea to become</p>
<p>Something we saw far off</p>
<p>Once, so will come to mean one thing </p>
<p>Later, when it&rsquo;s closer</p>

<p>Scale, a demented image of images</p>
<p>Changing size relative to theme music</p>

<p><u>My Full House</u></p>
<p>There are TV shows which absolutely conform to the collective&rsquo;s idea of a TV show&#151;</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">which willingly accept their place within the tradition&#151;and so refuse to differentiate themselves whatsoever &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;"><em>Full House</em> is the most exemplary of these shows </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">it is clearly one of the least innovative of the family sitcoms &nbsp;&nbsp;on the Big 3 &amp; throughout its run its sole purpose was seemingly to confirm basically everything we, as the audience, had come to believe as denoting &ldquo;our culture&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">which amounted to an understanding of genre, and our complete subservience to, and dominance of&#151;genre </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">As the audience of <em>Full House</em> we wanted <em>Full House</em> to be nothing short of a cultural artifact we would one day hold up as &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; of this need</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">as we watched we were comforted in our collective understanding of ourselves as the audience of <em>Full House</em></p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">as being in collective possession of an artifact as conforming as <em>Full House</em></p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;"><em>Full House</em> is brutally effective in its ability to comfort without ever elaborating on or identifying this process of collective conformity&#151;in comfort</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">Perhaps we want to believe ourselves part of a culture as interesting as anything Germany has produced&#151;</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">after all, do we not have culture? after all, are we not culture?&#151; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>perhaps here it is Jeff Franklin the show&rsquo;s producer and creator where we must look&#151;for irony and questioning of sitcom custom</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">Franklin in the 80s was a wealthy producer for Warner Bros, and something of a bad boy, he eagerly courted tabloids, controversy, and enjoyed exercising his power in the industry ruthlessly. His drug use was notorious. He had at least two documented breakdowns. He was said to enjoy Roman themed parties </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">ranklin is on the record as stating his father was abusive &#150;their relationship fraught, frayed&#151;ultimately frayed</p>
<p>what does this say about the triad of widowed males who comprise <em>Full House&rsquo;s</em> patriarchal structure?</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">Mark Warner, a critic, writes&#151;&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t stay glued to the normative family&#151;but to the supreme attempt to patch one together. We who are not queer or perverts or rebels or artists ourselves have no reason to pledge allegiance to the alterior. The demographic pledges allegiance to their culture&#151;it says yes, we are <em>The Milk Man, The Paper Boy, The Evening TV</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">Franklin&rsquo;s life; his gender, his money, his status, his high powered education&#151;all these bear out over the show; condition the plots which occur almost always without drama&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent:60px;">If we are to be honest with ourselves</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">our only mortality is being off screen</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">and this is why <em>Full House</em> more than <em>Family Matters</em> &#150;this is why the family of blonde daughters raised by 3 men&#151;has such a hold</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">we chose to shut ourselves inside this immortal familial constellation&#151;to raise one another like blinds&#151;to fill our interiors and to be made immortal by </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">the sacrifice of the obviously absent mother</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>as the show went on, attention turned to the youngest of the daughters&#151;who, by merely being before the camera&#151;from the earliest stage of consciousness to adult consciousness&#151;became a cipher, through which we explored the implications of life in the surveillance state</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">the constant gaze</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">and the limits of Self </p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">the Self which is and is not itself at any given time, on camera, before the camera</p>
<p style="text-indent:60px;">we as an audience experienced the youngest daughter as an actual and prescient event of doubling, and haunting&#151;the one always being the twin she is not </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the daughters became a religious zealot, shaved her head</p>
<p>Another bloated up, became addicted to drugs, saw ghosts</p>
<p>The twins refused to eat, became artists, and withered away</p>
<p>One of the dads elaborated on the very dirty nature of being a dad, became depressed, and literally stopped bathing</p>
<p>Another of the dads went into pornography, reached inside, to release the coils of his ancient Attic lust</p>
<p>Another of the dads tried to tell jokes that no one would laugh at. Or could laugh at. This humorless void would eventually defeat irony and usher in the age of sincerity once and for all </p>

<p><u>An ecstasy of beginnings </u></p>
<p>
these violently 
  culled coils these bright flowers these in a collision of 
  or collapse 
  of lines&#151;these flaming
  relics of poems these the difference this time extends
  through the other richer difference 
  of contracting 
  around or with or into or on </p>
<p>
these a capitalized term for blondes
  these flowers
  in their mouths like a glass
  rain their mouths are always breaking
  like a wind
  through my head
  a bough breaks and I am clean 
  minus the times when I am not always </p>

<p><u>A modern invention</u></p>
<br/>
<p>Joey beams as though Uncle Jesse were his invention</p>
<p>The Greek man</p>
<p>The Greek worker</p>
<p>The Greek debt</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am finished,&rdquo; Joey says, with the flourish of a magician</p>

<p><u>The new art</u></p>
<br/>
<p>Many attempts were made to cast Michelle </p>
<p>Into a large steel beam</p>
<br/>
<p>In gallery space. They suspended</p>
<p>Her from wire&#151;there, she was described as floating </p>
<p>&ldquo;Like an exchange rate&rdquo; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that margin </p>
<p>Between viewer and object</p>
<p>A face </p>
<p>Assumes itself like a definition</p>
<p>Through repeated error&#151;it looks back at itself</p>
<br/>
<p>It is terrifying?</p>
<p>Error of the gaze&#151;</p>
<p>It is cool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where were you when you first heard the word stagflation?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy blonde curls</p>
<p>Whimpering, I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>Not straight&#151;or I&rsquo;m not so happy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cast as a large steel beam</p>
<br/>
<p>In her mouth</p>
<br/>
<p>A cow&rsquo;s tongue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us recognize then this moment</p>
<br/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of dairy&#151;beaming </p>
<br/>
<p>In her mouth</p>
<p>Her words&#151;&ldquo;Having a cow&rdquo;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>In gallery space, the word white space</p>
<p>Passes for the first time as a sort of plural</p>
<p>For darkness through which </p>
<p>A mind cries. This is not unlike wind</p>
<p>The anal phase</p>
<p>Through which a consciousness</p>
<p>Embedded in our feelings&#151;passes &nbsp;</p>
<br/>
<p>As a thought&#151;and these thoughts are gas </p>
<p>Attendants to our shared sense of being here</p>
<p>Together, like walls&#151;and have in them </p>
<p>Artifacts of faces&#151;tho the vanished kind</p>
<p>Which belong to fabulations</p>
<p>Errors of translation in the ancient texts</p>
