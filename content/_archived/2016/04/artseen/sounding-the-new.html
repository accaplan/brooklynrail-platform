title: SOUNDING THE NEW CARRIE MOYER Sirens

<p align="center">DC MOORE GALLERY | FEBRUARY 18 &#150; MARCH 26, 2016</p><br/>
<p><em>Sirens</em>, Carrie Moyer&rsquo;s museum-quality d&eacute;but at DC Moore Gallery, consists of fourteen, mostly large-scale, almost garishly bright abstract paintings. Moyer is a veteran of the New York art scene, and has exhibited widely, most recently with SCAD. Her work has progressed since the early &rsquo;90s&#151;from graphic design-based, politically motivated work intended as queer activism, to representational painting, to abstract painting that borrows from 1970s feminist art. </p>!!img1!!
<p>In her current show, the references tend less toward Judy Chicago and more toward Matisse. Walking through, I was reminded of the <em>Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs</em> (October 12, 2014 &#150; February 10, 2015) at MoMA; it&rsquo;s interesting to note that Moyer plans her compositions by making small collages from cut paper. <em>Belvedere</em> (2016), which features arched windows as a frame looking into a space beyond, immediately brings to mind Matisse&rsquo;s classic <em>Dance</em> (1909). Goddesses with blunt heads frolic, their bodies dissolving into rounded forms that become one with a green mountainous landscape. But there&rsquo;s something playfully transgressive here as well: the stylized figures bop right out of the framed interior space, and glittery polka dots punctuate throughout. </p>
<p>Moyer&rsquo;s ambitious project is nothing less than a celebratory queering of abstraction. In as much as &ldquo;queer&rdquo; can be defined as a purposeful nonconforming, or a utopia envisioned outside of the quotidian, these paintings are queer. In <em>The Green Lantern</em> (2015), a cluster of opaque serpentine shapes frame the space, giving way to a frankly bizarre, bright-green, octopus-like form in the middle. It&rsquo;s goofy, funny, and surprising. <em>Sala de Dos Hermanos</em> (2015), a 72-inch-square piece centered on two arched window shapes, recalls stained glass in a church. But the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; itself is a blast of biomorphic freedoms. The frontal twin shapes could be seen as phalluses or breasts&#151;a contradiction, perhaps, unless you see it as intentionally genderqueer.</p>
<p>The paintings appear to have been caused by natural events. Chthonic, transparent poured areas are corralled by graphic, slabbed shapes reminiscent of cut paper. Neither of these sections looks brushed-on in the traditional sense. Abandoning the brush is a decisive choice for Moyer. The painter Catherine Murphy has described the mid-century brushstroke as a macho imperative she chose to reject. Amy Sillman and Louise Fishman, both influences on Moyer, reclaimed the Ab-Ex brushstroke to explore new possible meanings. But Moyer is also an inheritor of the irreverent, cartoonish forms of the &rsquo;80s, as exemplified in the work of Elizabeth Murray. In many ways, Moyer&rsquo;s somatic yet curiously bodiless work resembles that of a digital artist, or a sci-fi influenced artist. I get the feeling she&rsquo;s bypassing the brushstroke in order to imagine new ways of embodiment, perhaps offering a glimpse into the future. </p>
<p>There is a spiritual, ethereal, and religious aspect to Moyer&rsquo;s work, which marries the sacred to the profane. The saturated colors and shapes invoke joy. The paintings glow like stained glass windows; it&rsquo;s as if they are lit from behind by sunshine. Moyer&rsquo;s work is not after subtlety; it wants to knock your socks off. Chroma can be a form of confrontation (an early piece is titled <em>Chromafesto</em>). In this sense, unapologetic visual pleasure can be understood as a surrogate for unapologetic sexual pleasure. <em>Intergalactic Emoji Factory</em> (2015) displays a confrontational festivity that speaks to color&rsquo;s subversive power: a brilliant rainbow spectrum rises above a bed of black glitter. To me, the painting tells a theatrical story about gay pride, what it has meant and continues to mean&#151;affirmation, community, and the opposite of shame. It&rsquo;s interesting to consider Moyer&rsquo;s history in this context: in the &rsquo;90s, she co-founded the iconic public art project Dyke Action Machine. At the time, there was a sex-positive rallying cry in queer communities that was partly a response to the AIDS crisis. The affirmation of pleasure in the face of annihilation was both metaphorical and real. The slogan &ldquo;Silence = Death&rdquo; addressed the necessity of speaking up and fighting back, refusing to be ignored.</p>
<p><em>Vieni Qui Bella</em>, 2016, (&ldquo;Come Here, Beauty&rdquo;) is an ode to Moyer&rsquo;s wife, the fiber artist Sheila Pepe. A sheet of dripping blood-red paint is foregrounded by a web of green-grey ropelike forms that recall Pepe&rsquo;s multidimensional crocheted works. This piece is a reminder that for a lesbian to self-define and speak of pleasure is a political act. (Pepe, interested in similar themes, once titled a show Hot Lesbian Formalism.) Creative dialogue between romantic partners is something we&rsquo;re all familiar with through the example of countless heterosexual artist couples, but to witness this in a same-sex female couple is still new, and refreshing. </p>
<p>Despite Moyer&rsquo;s many influences and art historical references, her work does not look like anyone else&rsquo;s. She is creating new territory and forging her own language in paint. A kind of deep, bodily theatrics are at play in these smart, masterful paintings. It&rsquo;s hard to leave the gallery&#151;the works literally cajole the viewer to stay. Sirens gives more than it asks: it is fundamentally generous. This is a big, beautiful party to which we&rsquo;re all invited.&nbsp; </p>
