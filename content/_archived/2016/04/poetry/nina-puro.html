<p style="font-size: 13pt;">Under Pressure</p>
<br/>

<p style="font-size:10pt;">
Yes, I did know I was being used, &amp; how. That&rsquo;s one
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>of those songs someone&rsquo;s singing each second.
  A seed-tray sprouts in the shed&rsquo;s darkest corner. Friday ten kids 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>got shot. Tuesday a hurricane unshucked trees to matchsticks</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
two counties over. Just now I danced with a girl &amp; when
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>night breaks, she&rsquo;ll find another. I can&rsquo;t align with why I should hurt
  my way up&#133; &nbsp;nor why we ache to rely, &amp; to believe for a moment
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>time&rsquo;s malleable, &amp; grows back green, &amp; to forget hunger&rsquo;s tender</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
current. Slow star, quick blade. Night doesn&rsquo;t fall
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>or break: it seeps like blood plumes in water&#151;as silt, 
  as cream, as madness seeds wind.&nbsp; Books are a sheaf 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>of corpses in the language of the victors. I&rsquo;m to want to ink </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
my name on one in order to eke out my clearing. Houses are hollow 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>reliquaries built from books. I&rsquo;m sidling toward the door, a curtain
  of 4/4 pulsing at my heels. I throw my career under a bus 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>whenever possible, but I&rsquo;ve never wanted to carve my love</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
into bark. Others have. Men on mountaintops blazed paths
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>with their white names long after people palmed caves inside mountains 
  &amp; blew red powder to show where they&rsquo;d pressed. One removed; 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>one accrued. Most of what I think about is how to get smaller</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
so there&rsquo;s more later. Good days, I&rsquo;m frightened by this terrible tenderness 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>tendriling in me: what&rsquo;s not discharged festers. Maybe I&rsquo;m not cruel enough 
  to claw my way into the junkshop&rsquo;s interior, but I can&rsquo;t help dismantle the empire
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>when I&rsquo;m this stricken: knotting &amp; unknotting my scarf,&nbsp; trailing my trauma </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
to the chip aisle again. I know this: bad nights, every angle&rsquo;s a wall &amp; shadows blur
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>but what seems set against us is only itself, breathing quiet. Listen. If trees could talk, 
  they wouldn&rsquo;t. That sigh isn&rsquo;t tree. It&rsquo;s wind. Driving, your oasis is heat: you&rsquo;ll have
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>responses to this &amp; the responses will have responders&#151; the reams of ancestors </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
floating between us are who should be addressed. They can&rsquo;t be repaid. I&rsquo;ve this long 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>white debt. Various vistas will sweep around us, glow, get razed. 
  I should maybe go West for a bit. I&rsquo;m sorry. The aftermath 
<span style="margin-left:40px;"></span>of destruction is predictably peculiar. A hurricane, for example: after a flood,</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">
<span style="margin-left:90px;"></span>fires start. One goes back. One&rsquo;s never done.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13pt;">elegy with music box &amp; warm deer blood</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;">
each invitation chloroform
  trembling in ionized air
  reject their strings
  reject the duck I&nbsp; 
  cleaned of buckshot I
  can't remember when the 
  attacks started
  but they haven&rsquo;t 
  stopped something
  will be sore tomorrow
  I don&rsquo;t know what
  but I&rsquo;m doing it now
  I bit the hands
  that starved me
  but they 
  were mine
  just blow on the dice
  &amp; go
  you know how
  when numb fingers 
  get inside
  they burn?
  think of me
  as that 
  feeling.</p>
