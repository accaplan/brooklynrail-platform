I just got here so
  I don't know anything.
  Sun splendor at dawn
  is one thing, so I'll start
  with that. Also, something about electric bacteria
  in outer space, that's another thing.
  Out in the open, the dear world
  vibrates on a broad bandwidth. 20 uses
  of water include: bathing, cooking,
  and transportation, so there's that.
  Nothing was really happening
  except, &quot;Do not open this window.&quot;
  Last, but not least: people with
  good memories are scary to me.</p>

<p>
What appears to me now
  appears to be gone. An old New Yorker
  is under my arm. The aroma of meat 
  is thrilling on 5th Avenue.
  The angry falcon is in the van
  with our hero. Where there used to be
  boarded up storefronts there are now
  maps to those boarded up storefronts. 
  I ate her pudding. I had no ideas
  today. Audience members 
  at the advanced style screening
  appear to be throwing their hats at
  the door before they enter the theater.</p>

As you approach the resting spot
  practice good footing.
  Once you find the stream, 
  nestle next to it on your side.
  There, you will feel an exquisite
  sense of moving along.
  An interrupter is not well liked.
  Avoid a collision course with fancy, 
  but keep the emerald rods for hoarding.
  All days are ruthless and mathematical
  days. The city speaks for itself.
  Get something from the trunk and get evolved.
  A spray mist and a lozenge deliver
  the expanded stance. An eagle,
  some bird.</p>

Dear fever, please help me 
  pitch these hydrochloric pelts.
  My yellow mitten just tumbled down the street
  and the milk has gone chlorine pepper.
  I'll always get a lot out.</p>
<p>
Big personalities form alliances that leave pocks. 
  They are sugary and parental, but really fun and short of sharp.
  You are on the beach with rippled glimpses of ships.
  Look at the glare on that silver mast.
  Soothe us with your stories of the sea.</p>
<p>
The closest star to us is just not close at all.
  There is something in this for all of us.
  You wouldn&rsquo;t think of taking 
  half a car for half a block.
  The best ideas are from us.</p>

People are so awkward,
  they are banging around everywhere.
  Part of the reason
  the day plagues us 
  is because ambulances make a lot of sound 
  when they pick injured people up.
  I would like to embrace people
  who are determined to stick with it 
  when things get weird with a crisis.
  Lucky people respond to fractals.
  I do not really want this great cover to end,
  nor the tissue aspect of my body, or the internet.</p>
