title: LOST AND FOUND I. The Boat is Tethered to the&nbsp;Floor
---

<br/><div style="margin-left:105px;">
<p>Salt is drying &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuzz is thriving
Kelp&rsquo;s alive &#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8194;Space belies<br/>
The boat is tethered to the floor
The rum is in the chest behind the door, 
and wooden-legged pirates are more real 
than the &ldquo;if&rsquo;s&rdquo; of little boys.<br/>
I will be waiting on the wharf, 
wading distance,
whistling softly, 
stretching my breasts
to hillocks.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Birch beer and watercress and huckleberries,
baby torrents under wooden ferries, 
quahogs and clams and mussels.
That couldn&rsquo;t be a truffle underneath the log? 
The fog is in, shrouding this bay with mist. 
Pound your feet on the wrinkled sand.
Lick the salty fingers of your hand.<br/>
An open window, an unlatched door, 
berried seaweed seasoning the floor,
a spider swinging from the rafter. 
I will wait today, the day after, 
perhaps the next.
But if the moon is round, I may forget.<br/>
Come barefoot and ungloved.
Bring friendliness, less fragile and more versatile 
than love.<br/>
And do not harness me to promises.
Let us reach separately in each other&rsquo;s arms,<br/>
Unpin the wind.
Begin at the beginning&#151;beginnings spin.
Any beginning.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
If I could touch your garment
would I be calmed?
If you could savor me in your arms. &#133;
I&rsquo;m disturbed by words not clearly heard, 
promises of.<br/>
How may I reach you, and know Love? 
Where is the source? the toppled Force,
the once-upon-a-time?
What will I find?<br/>
Peace? Fear?
or the same threaded conclusions I find here? 
(threated?)</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Ah, for a higher degree 
of together, we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially &ldquo;we&rdquo;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m morally tired of me.<br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Finally?</span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Hoist me a la 
while I am moist 
and ajar</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
So
this is the spa,
the delicious &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Kelp</span>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">from the sea </span>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">helps you to</span><br/>
whelp
facsimile of yourself.
Take the Chinese, an amazing people, 
nourished by kelp for generations. 
They are discreetly prolific.<br/>
Eat what they eat.
Their size does not make them fertile and wise. 
It is their diet.<br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Surmise. </span>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Try it.</span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Never harness
me to a promise. 
Leave me 
unfastened.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
I woke up alone.
The pillow in my arms did not stir.<br/>
Tomorrow
will I wake instead,
your tangled hair damp on the bed, 
and the pillow
wet with sweat,
breathing, on the floor?</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Love swings like a tavern sign, 
without the mind.
How do you feel about things, 
How absolute,
how diluted?<br/>
I must know before
I dive into your sea</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">I, me, I = my together. Why?</span><br/>
I&rsquo;m tired of saying I 
I want to say we.
It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m lonely, only
I&rsquo;m tired of being just me.<br/>
I&rsquo;m tired of putting me first in each verse, 
Arguments won before they&rsquo;re begun,
Me and me always agree.
What a tiresome bore I must be. 
Me, get away from me.
Remove your hex from me. 
Oh, for an us or a let&rsquo;s, 
Nothing complex;
a choice,
another voice&#151;</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-left:100px;">
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your point of view?&rdquo;
or
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s warm up the stew&rdquo;
or
&ldquo;What can we do next?&rdquo;
or
Any old &ldquo;let&rsquo;s&rdquo;</p>
<p>
For instance,
When I raid the frig,
the drumstick&rsquo;s still there,
the milk and the pie and the cheese still there, 
nothing missing.
And what fun is cindering the toast,
and burning the roast with no one to fuss, 
like if I was part of an us?<br/>
A good fight&rsquo;s nice before dousing the light. 
I could weep blissfully while we made up.
But with no daring offender, or brazen surrender, 
what could occur that I&rsquo;d care to remember?
So I will sleep wistfully, with the shade up.<br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">dangerously, </span>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">derangedly,</span><br/>
I am sick of me. Sick,
Sick.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
There was more pith in &ldquo;with&rdquo;
than this &ldquo;without.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
I wonder did the pigeons come today 
and did they fly away
when they found I wasn&rsquo;t there.
I wonder did the sparrows come to play
and weave their nests from combings of my hair.
They&rsquo;ll miss the window where we shared our crumbs. 
The thing is done.
The folding walls are still and bare. 
I wonder did the pigeons come.<br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">(Most winged things smell</span> 
<span style="margin-left:325px;">farewell)</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">They came.</span><br/>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">I think they knew.</span>
<span style="margin-left:225px;">I think they cared.</span> </p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
If you have someone to weep for,
you are blest.
If you bring a child, another&rsquo;s grief, a new belief, 
close,
you are blest.
And when you seem again, it will not be the same, 
for you will know a little more of everything&#151;
shy you sing.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">either boy</span><br/>
Everything is
<span style="margin-left:50px;">somehow reverent </span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">and irreverent,</span>
a quandary 
of becauses:
<span style="margin-left:50px;">I love you because</span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">I don&rsquo;t love</span>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">you because</span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">I can&rsquo;t love</span>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">you because</span>
Love conceives. The 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">pith of love is </span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">love is love is </span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">love conceives.</span>
To evolve a fitting 
little boy, we
<span style="margin-left:30px;">must</span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
revolve in
innocent 
benevolent intent. 
Love is the 
embraced extent, 
the Signature<br/>
Everything that 
breathes conceives
<span style="margin-left:75px;">Simply reason</span>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">believe </span>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">know</span>
We have a
<span style="margin-left:75px;">little boy </span>
not a symbolic
<span style="margin-left:75px;">little boy </span>
but a colicky,
<span style="margin-left:75px;">burping </span>
<span style="margin-left:75px;">belching </span>
<span style="margin-left:75px;">little boy,</span>
as real as porridge<br/>
Don&rsquo;t bother to
<span style="margin-left:75px;">be horrified</span>
May I be a 
<span style="margin-left:75px;">mother, too</span>
made in your 
<span style="margin-left:75px;">image?</span>
or would that cause
<span style="margin-left:75px;">a holy scrimmage? </span>
Is there a see-saw
<span style="margin-left:75px;">or leavening</span>
<span style="margin-left:75px;">in heaven?</span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
You heard me screaming
You didn&rsquo;t miss a scream
Now it is too late.
What were you waiting for? 
This?<br/>
The trip 
the fall 
all of it.
I paid full fare
<span style="margin-left:100px;">To where?</span>
<span style="margin-left:100px;">where to?</span><br/>
You were waiting for this to happen
You knew it would happen 
You knew it would happen. 
You knew all along.
But I survived.
I found the beat.
I&rsquo;m Jason on two feet, in person,
choosing, fixing, building with Jason bricks. 
Jason l<u>i</u>ve! Scaling the pit.
Jason treating!</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
Look at all the 
men and women 
skimming<br/>
the kids with 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">pails</span>
the boards 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">with nails</span>
the Latins smelling 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">of life</span>
and the blacks 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">uptight</span>
and the old 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">whites </span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">waddling</span>
like pouter pigeons 
and the young 
whites spouting
religion<br/>
Chauvinists, 
feminists 
waving flags
<span style="margin-left:50px;">in their own parades </span>
in accordance with
<span style="margin-left:50px;">their own premises </span>
deviates from
<span style="margin-left:50px;">someone else&rsquo;s norms </span>
all glistening, listening
<span style="margin-left:50px;">re-christening</span>
Look at all the
<span style="margin-left:50px;">Children </span>
their eyes wise,
<span style="margin-left:50px;">surmising, </span>
devising a
<span style="margin-left:50px;">middle &#151;</span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-right:80px;">&#135;</p>

<p>
You only go &rsquo;round the one time 
for sure.
No after, no before. 
One spurt,
then dirt.
Best be hurt than undemanding. 
The same fall for us all.
Only a different landing.
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Bounce the ball!</span>
You only go &rsquo;round the one time. 
Be you as you go.
Say no to the cues. 
Lose the script 
Refuse the tableaux. 
Try! anything.
Take a bead at the sky!
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Bounce the ball!</span>
The one trip&#151; 
The quick sip, or 
the long swallow. 
Be led, or follow. 
Wallow in your I.
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Bounce the ball!</span>
Mount your my! 
Cry I, I, I,
I,
<span style="margin-left:225px;">Bounce the ball!</span>
Bounce the ball high!</p>
