title: HOMAGE TO LEROI JONES For O.B.

<p>
And when you said I pleased you, I looked aside 
  at the hot town and the fearful grove on its orange plain; 
  here was an end of confusion, beginning of pride, 
the present was born and the past had subtly died 
and you were beside me in Spain. </p>

<p>
When you said you loved me, I saw the future stand up 
free and alive, but through the open window 
  the railroad tracks led into silence, a wild cup 
  of silence held the year whose fires would not stop 
while the world lay under war-shadow. </p>

<p>
When I left you, you stood on the pier and held 
  your face up and never smiled, saying what we had found 
was a gift of the revolution &#151; and the boat sailed 
  while for a moment my sons emerged and stood in the world 
  as a line of shadows that fell back in that ground. </p>
