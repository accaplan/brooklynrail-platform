title: Premonition of Barrel Bombs (Syria)

<p style="font-size:10pt;">
One looks into a medium, John Dee&#146;s black scrying mirror, water, or in this case pigment.&nbsp;
The shapes form themselves on the page.&nbsp;
The bombs are loaded and dropped.&nbsp;
Black pixelating devices transmit the image.&nbsp;
An image of barrel bombs.&nbsp;
The picture arrived first. The image came second.&nbsp;
People on the ground forever transformed.&nbsp;
Could the making of the picture change the outcome of the image?
