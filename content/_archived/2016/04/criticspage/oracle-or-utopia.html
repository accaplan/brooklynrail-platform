They sought to erase from my face
  all evidence
  that I had lived<br/>
  They used needles to do it. Extraction methods and plumping.<br/>
  Ocean makes a slurry sound behind my head
  a o sound<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was silent as the atoms were gathering
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it got noisy<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound made the ocean make sound &amp;<br/>
  We found history on the Earth&rsquo;s wrinkled face<br/>
  *<br/>
  seen a woman who rhymed with time<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does her decay
  does her primordial radionuclide dress 
  and its disintegrating daughters
  do time<br/>
  *<br/>
  when you peel off your dead skin to see the face of the world
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the already-dead go deathly pale
  self is a god we walked through&#8195;&#8195;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was an idiot&#8194;It was a mistake
  I believe something here
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What self?
  I do not believe the man-made sky
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think like a hero
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think like a dog
  I was looking for the real sky
  I want more face, more mother
  more atoms moving through the heart
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get ready
  I am taking man back for woman, mankind</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
