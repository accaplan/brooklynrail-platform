  UGLY DUCKLING PRESSE i. Preface, Part I of
  Love,&nbsp;Delight,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alarm

<div style="margin-left:150px;">
<p>
Along a plane I wanted to write it:
  Where one end is fixed, a loose sun<br>
  To the excess of dark I was certain
  That certainty&rsquo;s a kind of excess<br>
  A term that&rsquo;s but a navigating bust
  A place to version a limit, feet in foot<br>
  When the lute&rsquo;s sum turns daily
  As if by steam one could coordinate<br>
  The tulips, too numerous to pinch
  By steam the autography of material<br>
  Will appear to light the vapor region
  So we can know it as if by touch<br>
  A nude thing, the masses say
  As they re-substantiate again</p>
