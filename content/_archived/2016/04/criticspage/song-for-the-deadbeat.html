<p>
A father who didn&rsquo;t see or write now mourns his son&rsquo;s passing on the Internet
takes up the pity handkerchief on a Conspiracy Plotters&rsquo; List Serve
American flags wave in Adobe Flash, where knowing &ldquo;Our Rights&rdquo; is a dot com URL
hosting the male economy on a flash drive 
is the hard-drive&rsquo;s shirt-and-tie set 
downloading itself under a Reagan Paternity&rsquo;s 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">1980s Pacific-coast sunset</span><br/>
If it&rsquo;s against Civil Rights to support a living child 
must the dead child remain silent? </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>
Empty beer bottles and Chardonnay glasses rim a red overture 
in my memory-mind California&rsquo;s consorting twisting curves 
Hell&rsquo;s Angels teams behind and before me
if paranoia for repetition can be forgiven&#151; 
so unpleasant, how love switched 
commandeering
a sentence<br/>
darts the heart harpoon 
Dances the I-tunes
strains my rocking chair&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;my swaddled babe 
rocks rocks rocks&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;the cradle waves
spills over like abandonment <br/>
dirt of the desert stings 
visiting at high altitudes<br/>
Turn that bacon over under Morning Star&#151;let me sing
O Daddy Deadbeat, <em>la la la</em>
I don&rsquo;t love you, I could loan you 
the girly zines I found
in a burned-down forest shack close to Yosemite
and if you feel better crooning 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">for Law and Land</span>
don&rsquo;t let me screw up the misery&#151;your loss 
from sea to shining sea <em>was</em> America the beautiful, <em>is </em>
his mimicry lost on you<br/>
Love is not a Window (as in Microsoft)
I watch the drifting leaves on another shore 
washing a boy&rsquo;s tombstone 
another mountain, by design 
leaves leaves to fertilize 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">the dead son</span>
hand-held and helped
<span style="margin-left:50px;">our little bird </span>
who grew 
<span style="margin-left:50px;">more man than the man pirating</span>
<span style="margin-left:50px;">ragged outline of vicarious sorrow</span></p>
