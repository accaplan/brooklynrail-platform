<div style="margin-left:150px;">
<p>
Someday, when will I lose you?
Will you be able to sleep without me?
Will you hear me whispering in your dream?
Like a star-anise growing next to you?</p>
<p>
My words are your eyelids
Do your breasts listen? Will your
love listen like a melissa kissing
my eyelids with your mouth?</p>
<p>
We both close and leave
We&rsquo;re both one but are each other&rsquo;s
Like a garden that can kiss
Like the kiss that comes before more kisses</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
