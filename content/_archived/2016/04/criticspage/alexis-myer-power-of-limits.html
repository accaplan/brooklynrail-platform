title: ALEXIS MYRE Power&nbsp;of&nbsp;Limits
---

<p>&ldquo;Looking at it just makes my fingers feel fat&rdquo; said Billy, a man from Denver who has average sized hands. I knew exactly how he felt.</p>
<p>We were squinting and squatting inside Alexis Myre&rsquo;s studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn a week before her first NYC solo show, <em>Power of Limits</em>, opened at La Mama Galleria. Myre rents a small space on the top floor of a Second Avenue warehouse that was a colossus of production in the previous millennium. (Advertised features include &ldquo;a freight elevator and a slop sink.&rdquo;) This faded-brick mammoth rests near the banks of the Gowanus and looks out over it toward lower Manhattan where I spend most days in a palatial glass mall, at a sit/stand desk, in an eighteenth-floor office, near a window that looks back to here.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Climbing four flights up the rusted metal staircase, it feels good to breathe hard. And to be in a place that is, so plainly, both a testament and memorial to working-class labor. Stepping into Myre&rsquo;s room after navigating a long, white hallway is like entering the shrine of a temple where objects of many forms have been gathered under a shared devotion to line and life or (in academic terms) math and biology. Pinned to the work are labels like &ldquo;<em>Directions of Change </em>(2014), silk thread, pencil, peach pit, and paint on Plexiglas&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Lissajous </em>(2015 &#150; 16 ), felt, pPexiglas, silver, and wild grass seed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Viewing Myre&rsquo;s art within the setting of this factory, my mind churns overtime to decipher exactly what type of force is at work here. The wall pieces could be pages from a da Vinci codex, if he had access to a graphing calculator with a 3D printer that renders solutions in silk thread and seeds. Exploring concepts like infinity, imaginary numbers, symmetry, and dimension, these works echo the narrative of a physicist&rsquo;s working journal. Instead of blank paper, Myre executes her ideas on Plexiglas tinted in the austere blues and greens of surgical scrubs. Nonlinear functions express their shapes in a filigree of thread and pencil with variables denoted by organic materials. If I only looked at the wall pieces, I would have deemed them products of a logical mind. But in the opposite corner of the studio are these &ldquo;things&rdquo; which make that claim ridiculous.</p>
<p>Myre refers to these objects as sculptures. They look like preserved organisms or holy relics from a parallel dimension. They are strange creatures, appearing organic in shape and yet when you look closer, it&rsquo;s obvious that they are an amalgamation of materials and mechanisms. The titles seemingly derive from a nomenclature system based on mathematics rather than Latin. The little <em>Lissajous </em>(a felt larva with a glass-bulb head and a tail tipped with a peach-pit stinger) is named after the 19th-century physicist who invented the first apparatus to graph parametric equations. </p>
<p>There is an almost instinctual reaction to Myre&rsquo;s art that compels the viewer to get up close (and then closer) with it in order to understand it better&#151;to look up into it or down on over it&#151;the way we move around specimens in a natural history museum. And like a biological specimen, Myre&rsquo;s art lures the observer to an intersection of study and display. It is at this junction that I encounter Billy from Denver, kneeling to inspect an intricate curve formed by hundreds of silk lines and red-tipped needles. <br>
  As a skilled contractor, he works with his hands and makes much with them. But he&rsquo;s never made anything like this. I agree with him that such labor doesn&rsquo;t even seem possible.</p>
