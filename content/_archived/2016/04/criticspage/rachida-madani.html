Time passes and takes half
  her face away
  while of the other half so few
  words remain
  so few images
  that she can&rsquo;t make
  a poor book.
  So little saliva that scraping dryness
  her voice cracks and breaks.
  Lost, the dream of the howling seas
  storming the jade palaces
  lost because of the spell wishing
  Shahrayar long life and prosperity.
  She can no longer take off in pursuit of
  the renegades.
  She can no longer advance
  she can no longer say if it hurts
  she no longer knows if she writes haltingly
  or if the words fly into her face.
  She no longer knows with which stick
  to root around which space.
  She writes as if blind
  &amp; fear is her companion.</p>

<p>
Through what rip
  path of violence and blood
  did you enter
  Thirst
  into this body without shadow?
  An oasis quick
  a well
  a truce.
  Death laughter&rsquo;s sidekick
  laughter&rsquo;s claws
  launches its vultures
  on my bare shoulders.
  If I fall the sun hits
  and road snakes assault me
  lead my caravans astray.
  If toward heaven I attempt
  a scream of rage and agony
  my call loses itself
  in a silence always stronger
  than the storm.
  But allied to the
  quicksands my scream
  makes the pathway toward oblivion
  impracticable.</p>
