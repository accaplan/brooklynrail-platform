<p>
My mind is a basket of water
  descending at daylight into melon-smacked sky.
  Rose, gray, tangerine of morning
  from dark space blue.</p>
<p>
A meteor flashed by
  or was it Morning Star?
  Her face lighting world
  signaling night to day
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day to light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Snow drift clouds lake, then 
  split cleans earth/sky/city space.</p>
<p>
Blush between gray,
  glimmer of sun, flanked,
  Sun dogs heel.</p>
<p>
Searching sky lung-like, open,
  cupped leaves turn up to receive water.</p>
<p>
Simple receptacles palm dreams
  landing in drops larger than weeping.</p>
<p>
Sweeping evaporation come home 
  til it rains fish and dogs.</p>
<p>
Here it is&nbsp;
  higher than old growth piney tops
  higher than marbled plates topping bluff
  grass like water, too, filled with rain,
  dropping into pinprick gleam
  big sieve of night. Us, we
  land in some universal nebula,
  something spread out shining, waiting,
  deep river of the dead,
  the rookery out back
  calling.</p>
<p>
Vultures saddle cat-killed deer, haunches split.
  Crickets, tarantula, wolf spiders, recluses, 
  fire ants, mice, rats, bottle flies, mites &#150;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of them feed, all over.</p>
<p>
When bats, moths, move
  through marmalade, plum
  fall, night, evening grows wide.
  Mycosis of frogs, chytrid, 
  white nose fungus,
  Zika, or not, Dengue.</p>
<p>
Wool hangs over day diminished,
  with only yellow glimpse
  above the pasture pooled in flood.
  Mustangs, half-medicine hat,
  frost buckskin, still sip and chew below.</p>
<p>
We are deprived seeing into the world.
  Reflecting ourselves when nothing.</p>
<p>
The politics of global non-recognition.</p>
<p>
In mist, is human/dead horse, 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beat over and over each era.</p>
<p>
Cold, a scrim of rain.
  Earthquakes.
  Bellwether.</p>
<p>
All along the dead horse watch. </p>
