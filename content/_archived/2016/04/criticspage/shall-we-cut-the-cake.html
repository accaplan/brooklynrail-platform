<p align="justify" style="margin-left:192px;margin-right:200px;">Tuesdays 8.45 they do the kill list that&rsquo;s men with short haircuts fan out a pack of cards (think baseball) each card (no shuffling) a guy they&rsquo;d like to kill they don&rsquo;t say <em>kill</em> they say <em>target</em> they don&rsquo;t call him <em>imperator</em> though he flashes the same thumb up/ thumb down sign after each card as a certain sublime and sovereign Holy Roman toastmaster did centuries ago and (come to think of it) guys reviewing movies on TV &#151; the thumb thing &#151; so we&rsquo;re all on HBO? old idea why does it keep standing there like a blind butler or as Aissa said (with her family blown to bits in an inexact drone strike and her grandmother&rsquo;s hand melted onto the wedding cake while the arms lay out in the street so she had to gather them one by one) <em>I wanted to make it look real</em>. </p>
