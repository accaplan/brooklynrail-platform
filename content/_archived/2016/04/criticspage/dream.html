<p>big buddha, really huge, at least 100 feet high. People come up and pay homage. An earthy lady of the land offers that part of herself. <br>
  Then an old woman in her 70s comes up the walk to the buddha and reaching down grabs a seed from a bowl or basket of fruit and throws it in the face of the buddha. All the journals on Zen for months afterwards have articles on &ldquo;The Woman Who Threw the Pip in the face of the buddha.&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;i have crossed this ocean 9 times to do this, but never had the nerve until now,&rdquo; she states. </p>

  DREAM </p>
<p>Albert (Saijo) is not doing Za-Zen right, stopping it short to give a lecture of his own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Duncan is there, doing La-Zen. With ropes around our waist we run around the house in the snow. A crack the whip effect is pro- duced by Robert when he wants. <br>
  This is called Running Zen. </p>
