<p>The following is one in a series of four texts written by Etel Adnan, initially upon receiving a postcard from Tunisia, from her friend Khaled Najar, who then translated them into Arabic, and published them with his press, TAWBAD. The short poems are direct, darting with politics, with distance, pain, insomnia, the love of detail.</p>

what is new
in my life: the discovery
of a mass of stars in the
Milky Way<br/>
to flee the pocket of air
created by a bomb in 
a Baghdad suburb I reread
the words of Al-Sayyab<br/>
to ward off adversity,
time speeds up the apparition
of flowers&#8195;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children
play<br/>
caught in the trap of our imagination
the angels appear in our 
desires; the first light of day 
provokes their vanishing<br/>
sadness punctures the walls of
the spirit which transforms [so
in rice fields and in trenches]<br/>
walk on the perimeter
of your dreams. it&#146;s not 
that the ways are blocked
but that the hearts have
succumbed to the wind&#146;s violence<br/>
absence. displacement.
waiting. then comes rejection.
anger follows. shame makes
the beds<br/>
the shadows crowd between
the walls of the scarcely visited cities.
time nips at our heels&#8195;we are 
afraid to arrive last<br/>
I love the rain when it
envelops me as much as a 
river. it grafts me to the clouds.
I partake in the qualities
of the sky. I grow
like a tree<br/>
the souls of the disappeared&#8195;use
the television screen
tell me nothing
don&#146;t knock at my door<br/>
can spring age in 
a few hours? the outcome
of this battle depends on
the response to this question<br/>
a head riddled with bullets
filters the pain drop by 
drop on the floor of 
the kitchen where the family gathers<br/>
when thoughts come out all
colored from the brain&#146;s corridors
the great paintings on 
which are born&#8195;the looks
wear out, and depart<br/>
there are wounds 
waiting for the heart
to dress them<br/>
she buried her face
in a mattress the curve
of her back showed the loss
was unbearable<br/>
bleeding, a windy
crossroads, a taxi. this is how
the days begin<br/>
everything falls in the autumn
of contradictions. the past
inhabits us in the most 
poisonous forms because blood is
polluted with fatty matter,
and with thoughts<br/>
halos of cold gas
separate us from our origins. our
perceptions surf on a ray 
of light<br/>
in the meantime I swim in the
afternoon sun toward the 
pleasure of the senses &#133; even though
it can only be spent
in the body&#146;s passivity <br/>
the great apes were mutilated 
by mens&#146; jealousy. our
conversations remain faithful to
their banality<br/>
the sea is unleashed
and the earth is without support<br/>
blue-shaded lightning bolts
argue over the solitude of every fragment of 
Being, of every will to live<br/>
Paradise Lost is not summed up
by an affair of palm groves.
and if I told you it was made
of sleeping bodies and early
wakings &#133; <br/>
in the nonchalance of this day
the shadows stretch
under the trees to mingle
better with the night<br/>
we take the boat parting 
for the islands&#8195;even as
the horizon travels to the rhythm of
our inexistence<br/>
drink a glass of wine, you will be
warm in your body, you 
will think of Dionysus<br/>
we were born at the origin of
sadness&#8195;that&#146;s why our parties
astonish. they end up 
burning children and houses<br/>
the stars go out at intervals
of several seconds; the time
it takes information to cross
worlds
I watched the sky a-sheep
with clouds; I saw Arab 
poets sitting in front of black coffees<br/>
I witnessed their efforts.
some sold their words 
for a bite of bread,
others, their wives, but none
of them relinquished their
dreams<br/>
I went to sleep in sheets
bathed in my sweat. the month
of August in Beirut happens 
without the world knowing<br/>
there is no other consolation
left against pain than 
pain itself <br/>
desire intensifies on the 
silver edge of the sea. my friends,
don&#146;t wait for me any longer, my heart
is in the profusion of the same spring
as yours <br/>
listen to the sound of your arteries:
they were formed in the image
of the great rivers of Africa
that carry more fire than water<br/>
the mountain becomes a slide
of the razor. the moon is eaten
by the eclipse. the women, in the
morning, swim to rid
their body of insomnia, of sweat,
and of endured kisses<br/>
me, I love the still 
sunsets. I fear the day 
as much as the night
