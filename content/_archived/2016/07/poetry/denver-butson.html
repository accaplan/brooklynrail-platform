Independence Day </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left:125px;margin-right:125px;">
on the 4th of July at almost midnight.&nbsp; when the official fireworks are long over.&nbsp; and only a stray rocket goes off from time to time from the stoops of the locals.&nbsp; who have been here for generations.&nbsp; <em>so fuck off with your yuppie whining.&nbsp; this is America</em>.&nbsp; <em>get over it. </em>&nbsp;and the fat kid comes out from the brownstone across the street with at least three if not four generations living in it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m never quite sure because I can&rsquo;t tell the grandmother and the great-grandmother apart. I think they are two different people but they wear identical <em>Nonna Smocks</em>.&nbsp; and wave to my daughter and tell me how pretty she is.&nbsp; and I don&rsquo;t know if Frank Sr. is Anthony Sr.&rsquo;s dad or his brother.&nbsp; and the fat kid is named Anthony too.&nbsp; like the mentally challenged guy who must be Anthony Jr.&rsquo;s cousin, or maybe his uncle is named Frank or Frankie, but he doesn&rsquo;t let me call him Frankie even though my daughter can call him that.&nbsp; when he waits for the bus to pick him up out front every afternoon.&nbsp; and says <em>bye mommy </em>and <em>tell daddy I love him</em> before he gets on with the other fifty-some-year-olds going to work somewhere downtown.&nbsp; the fat kid Anthony comes out of the house.&nbsp; with a baseball bat. and I think for a second that he&rsquo;s going to walk right over to me and beat me with it.&nbsp; for coming here.&nbsp; with my wife and daughter.&nbsp; and locking our bikes to the fence.&nbsp; and sitting on our stoop with our popsicles.&nbsp; and our wine. in the evening.&nbsp; in other words <em>taking over</em>.&nbsp; but he can&rsquo;t see me sitting there.&nbsp; I realize.&nbsp; and he goes into the middle of the street.&nbsp; with his baseball bat.&nbsp; because this is Brooklyn.&nbsp; and even though he has room to swing it in front of his grandmother or great grandmother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; the place to swing a bat for crissakes is right in the middle of the goddamn street.&nbsp; and swing it he does.&nbsp; after holding it high over his back shoulder and bouncing a little in his stance.&nbsp; he swings big.&nbsp; over and over again.&nbsp; and then just before he goes in.&nbsp; which must be midnight by now.&nbsp; and no longer the 4th of July.&nbsp; but simply the 5th.&nbsp; the day after the day we blow up Chinese rockets and look at Chinese lights in the sky.&nbsp; to celebrate how free we are.&nbsp; the fat kid.&nbsp; Anthony.&nbsp; takes his final swing.&nbsp; but not before pointing with his bat.&nbsp; &agrave; la Babe Ruth.&nbsp; or maybe someone else he is more familiar with.&nbsp; a current Yankee.&nbsp; or Met.&nbsp; but not a Brooklyn Dodger.&nbsp; who Jerry the Ears from down the street says <em>single-handedly ruined baseball </em>by going to Los Angeles and <em>baseball, hell the world, ain't been the same since.</em>&nbsp; Anthony points his bat up to the centerfield bleachers and holds it there a second.&nbsp; looking right into the pitcher&rsquo;s eyes and then he pulls the bat back over his shoulder.&nbsp; And swings.&nbsp; his biggest swing yet.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left:125px;margin-right:125px;">
and I couldn&rsquo;t see it from where I was sitting.&nbsp; but the ball must have gone right where he pointed.&nbsp; because Anthony dropped his bat with a clang in the otherwise silent street.&nbsp; and raised his arms and circled the bases in triumph.&nbsp; as I sat there and watched.&nbsp; the only real spectator to his miraculous homerun.&nbsp; and I wanted to get up and cheer. the return of baseball to Brooklyn.&nbsp; finally after almost 60 years. but I just sat there.&nbsp; quiet as an intruder.&nbsp; a true brooklynite would have yelled and whooped.&nbsp; or at least told Anthony to <em>keep it the fuck quiet</em>.&nbsp; but I just sat there.&nbsp; in my expensive seat.&nbsp; silently rooting. until Anthony picked up his bat.&nbsp; looked up and down the street and right past me.&nbsp; and then went back in to his house.&nbsp; a hero among us all.</p>

watch over me </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
that on the same day the news broke 
  that <em>Big Tex </em>the giant cowboy 
  who stood over the Texas State Fair 
  since 1952 and welcomed visitors 
  with his big Texas <em>Howdy Folks</em> 
  was engulfed in flames and perished in those flames 
  while thousands of fairgoers and tourists 
  stood watching in horror in the parking lot 
  on their way into the fair&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  as he melted and disappeared 
  almost entirely behind the black clouds and the flames 
  his giant smile and big open hands 
  the only parts of him visible while he burned 
  until he was nothing but that smile and those hands 
  and the steel skeleton once invisible 
  under his fiberglass skin and clothes 
  a skeleton originally made for 
  a giant Santa Claus one article said 
  but was then appropriated for <em>Big Tex</em> 
  and which had been Big Tex's skeleton ever since </p>
<p>
my wife emailed me a help wanted ad 
  written by a young woman asking for someone to sit beside her 
  and watch over her while she slept 
  and asking that that someone be dressed in a <em>little owl costume</em> 
  or for slightly less pay at least stick a few feathers 
  to his or her forehead and sit beside her 
  while she went to sleep and finally slept 
  feeling safe and secure because she has always 
  <em>taken great comfort</em> in the idea that owls 
  are the natural watchmen of the night 
  and thinking that maybe the person 
  who would respond to her ad 
  would be an actor or have some experience in the theater 
  and would be able to work a shift from 11pm until 6 am 
  and only take short breaks to eat 
  and preferably with his or her owl head 
  turned away from her sleeping 
  and only after she had fallen asleep of course 
  because she did not want to be disturbed 
  by the fact of the owl's eating 
  (<em>this is no joke</em> the woman wrote
  <em>and all joke replies will be deleted)</em></p>
<p>
that the fire that ended the life of Big Tex 
  began in the wiring of his voice box 
  and then spread through the wiring 
  throughout his giant body 
  and that the man whose voice 
  was the actual voice of Big Tex 
  who worked out of a building nearby 
  welcoming visitors and providing other important announcements 
  in the voice of Big Tex 
  and through the big Texas smile 
  fifty some feet above the fair 
  was in that building when Big Tex started burning 
  and thankfully was not making announcements 
  at the time of his burning but on his lunch break 
  so the fairgoers were spared the further macabre experience 
  of being welcomed to the State Fair in Tex's big cheery drawl 
  and being told matter-of-factly where to eat or park 
  by the smiling mouth of a cowboy 
  as he was swallowed by flames 
  in the same calm gentle voice as always 
  with no indication that flames were reducing him 
  to a charred skeleton&nbsp;&nbsp; those outstretched palms&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  a smile and ash </p>
<p>
that on this day I read about this 
  and saw pictures and video of Big Tex 
  before during and after the flames 
  and saw pictures also of a little boy in his father's arms 
  wailing and looking up 
  at what could only be Big Tex melting away 
  and read that the little boy had talked of nothing else 
  but seeing the giant cowboy for the weeks 
  leading up to this day 
  only to step out of the car 
  and see Big Tex burning 
  and read also of the no-longer children 
  remembering that Big Tex 
  was their anchor in the crowds 
  entering or leaving the fair 
  some of them nearly fifty years ago 
  just after Big Tex first appeared there 
  reminiscing that they could never be lost because of him 
  because he was where they knew to go 
  if they ever got separated from their families </p>
<p>
this is no joke 
  all joke replies will be deleted </p>
<p>
that I may never know if the woman 
  who wanted an owl 
  to watch over her while she slept 
  able to sleep knowing that the owl 
  would be there watching over her 
  and knew that she wanted it so clearly 
  that she took out an ad to find this owl 
  or possibly combination of owls 
  to cover all shifts 
  to assure her that no hour of any night 
  of her falling asleep and sleeping 
  would go unwatched 
  ever found the right candidate 
  an out-of-work actor willing to dress as an owl 
  or affix a few feathers to his or her forehead 
  and watch her as she dreams </p>
<p>
or if the man with the voice of Big Tex 
  now that the blackened remains of Big Tex 
  have been lowered onto a flatbed 
  and driven away in what more than one bystander 
  called <em>a very solemn funeral procession</em>
  his oddly surviving and still-open palms 
  stretched up to the heavens as they took him away 
  has found other work for his huge friendly voice 
  while the state of Texas is restoring Big Tex 
  to be <em>bigger and better than ever</em>
  or if he is lost without a giant cowboy 
  to mouth the words coming from him 
  and if he sometimes wanders around lost 
  in his hours and hours of days 
  muttering <em>Howdy Folks</em> to his wife and walls 
  and that maybe he should find other work 
  I heard a woman is looking for someone 
  to watch over her as she sleeps&nbsp; 
  that doesn't sound so bad 
  he has watched over so many </p>
<p>
that I'll never know the answers to these questions 
  and that I wouldn't even have these questions at all 
  if it hadn't been that the same day Big Tex burned 
  I learned about the woman 
  who wanted an owl to watch over her sleeping 
  and both became forever linked in my mind 
  even though the cowboy burned in Texas 
  and the woman advertised for a watching-over owl 
  in I believe Canada </p>
<p>
does not lead me to any conclusions 
  about the frailty of what seems permanent 
  like giant cowboys or the need we all have 
  for someone to watch over us 
  whether it be that cowboy with his forever smile 
  or that actor dressed as an owl 
  sneaking bites of the muesli bar the woman left for him 
  to eat with his mouth turned away 
  only after she is fully asleep </p>
<p>
or even to question our assumptions 
  about what we hold onto 
  and what we believe to be bigger 
  and stronger than we are </p>
<p>
but perhaps it should 
  perhaps I should see answers 
  in the tears of the little boy 
  watching Big Tex burn 
  or in the assumed mutterings of the man 
  who was the voice of Big Tex 
  or in the actor in an owl suit 
  highlighting audition notices 
  while the watched-over woman sleeps </p>
<p>
perhaps I should take something from this 
  other than the simple fact that this is not a joke 
  that Big Tex with his skeleton meant for Santa Claus 
  will be back next year &nbsp;that future little boys 
  and little girls will meet under his smile and hands 
  that they will sleep well having finally seen him 
  knowing or at least believing that he is there and always will be </p>
<p>
and perhaps if nothing else I should take great comfort 
  that most likely the woman who is having trouble sleeping 
  hasn't seen the pictures I saw 
  of Big Tex's undisturbed smile behind the flames 
  and that same smile never un-smiling 
  as his remains were driven away on the funeral flatbed </p>
<p>
and that tonight as she lies down to sleep her owl is there 
  happy to have some paying work between gigs 
  and going over lines in his or her head 
  and that in the sleeping woman's mind 
  the Big Texes of this world never burn 
  and are never hauled away 
  as barely more than the skeletons 
  that were never even meant for them anyway 
  their intact smiles and hands open 
  for the stars to pour their wishes or meaning into </p>
<p>
or so we can all hope 
  that this is no joke </p>
<p>
or so at least I can hope 
  that all joke replies will be deleted </p>
