<p>a low tone, a bellow </p>
<p>and they were all said </p>
<p>to have left the span</p>
<p>apart with strangers</p>
<p>though that it should never have been </p>
<p>sought, fled or lit is calling forth </p>
<p>form from a port within (.) it</p>
<p>thus, i stayed it, started </p>
<p>for an intimation a</p>
<p>sudden nothing but remaining </p>
<p>small and admittedly it was nearly</p>
<p>all possible, tall grasses </p>
<p>then with still bent thin stalk </p>
<p>or what appeared as blank husks</p>
<p>fell, (their) greens dimming swaths as</p>
<p>they should around me, lips </p>
<p>and bouts of distance </p>
<p>that had their own years </p>
<p>all this fill i</p>
<p>gaped obediently at </p>
<p>as it then came close</p>
<p>settled short for a while </p>
<p>with breads and fruits as tresses for </p>
<p>mere repetition, the strange glow </p>
<p>of all the sudden recurs in limb</p>
<p>numbs them bright, stables </p>
<p>for indecision</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px"> in case of </p>
<p>need: imperfection</p>
<p>clothed and spoke to</p>
<p>be loathe to remarkably more</p>
<p>than mouthing someone pent</p>
<p>unless gaps dispel and soon </p>
<p>empty amid plinth</p>
<p>greens, why not go to them (?)</p>
<p>if you will you will </p>
<p>gleam from it quietly non-</p>
<p>glare given here scattered as</p>
<p>pitches at nearly empty </p>
<p>hollows and shine that have</p>
<p>been shown us to prevent all this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">what then is there still to be</p>
<p>left out, to be small</p>
<p>with to be still with</p>
<p>the still seen, all this ore-</p>
<p>glow to yield to</p>
<p>dew unbeading and not that</p>
<p>a drop dismantled hides me in order</p>
<p>not to go to them, a forced home </p>
<p>in notation, grasses, a name out</p>
<p>inaccessible resound no</p>
<p>surfaces were returned me but maps</p>
<p>without accumulation no one will </p>
<p>be there holding up</p>
<p>eponymous as though with cold</p>
<p>if it should be allowed </p>
<p>a title to occupy it, immed</p>
<p>then, or on is it</p>
<p>acres of frost almost </p>
<p>barking that they should</p>
<p>not be emphasized</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">to fail nuance, i finally gained the ruin</p>
<p>its least seen side or the rest</p>
<p>coloring leaves behind</p>
<p>or a small wood with no constraints </p>
<p>on replacing need </p>
<p>poised to lop off a fragment a(t) length</p>
<p>of needle jutted out and shook, bore </p>
<p>shade down a bit </p>
<p>that it is possible </p>
<p>to point anywhere longer</p>
<p>than the sound or the bend </p>
<p>it rounds, that is something</p>
<p>searched carefully enough</p>
<p>such that it can be approached, that is</p>
<p>how is one at its none<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">i would have</p>
<p>to begin to make a sound</p>
<p>to wish to arrive yet did not</p>
<p>instead audibly huddled, immediacy pulled</p>
<p>from clean grey plumage middle</p>
<p>dim rods slumped over the dents in things</p>
<p>that pose as what they impress</p>
<p>and though they all grew out</p>
<p>wards gaining one another, conifer </p>
<p>nettle bits, however it is said</p>
<p>to be unmarked or (un)toward</p>
<p>how possible is its remaining </p>
<p>hulled up as all objects are</p>
<p>
  seeping away then to</p>
<p>come back little once i've stopped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">something to do with sides you've disappeared </p>
<p>into, face in the shake quickly</p>
<p>abolish this ambiguity</p>
<p>and replace it with </p>
<p>another i decidedly crest</p>
<p>and the varying distances from </p>
<p>the embrace of small hills on </p>
<p>certainty below here admits</p>
<p>wonder without referring to it, seeing </p>
<p>oneself off cliff-lip with </p>
<p>a fall and this too blimps, veers</p>
<p>aside in this way carries out light</p>
<p>furnished by such a source gathered</p>
<p>from, lent to, left by</p>
<p>something unnoticed then improved</p>
<p>upon, i thought you</p>
<p>resemblance was (us) unremarkable</p>
<p>a tunnel that enclosed </p>
<p>slept us like a blow or was itself </p>
<p>listening for duress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">what would a mistake</p>
<p>here look like, a small brook</p>
<p>stilling focus as examples</p>
<p>standing for entire bodies in</p>
<p>which one can not take any</p>
<p>step for focus or what brimmed</p>
<p>there assumes a too </p>
<p>few, where the trees</p>
<p>caustic though not too, spill</p>
<p>uneven brown gravel</p>
<p>such that dusts cone up </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">to be mapped was</p>
<p>then not a lack at</p>
<p>all but talk of their draw on me</p>
<p>a cause to be at a</p>
<p>loss more rigorously flawed </p>
<p>than its object and </p>
<p>despite all that is dinned into </p>
<p>i left everything </p>
<p>out except </p>
<p>that one was lead</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">there yellows limn</p>
<p>fleeing points, the top twelve feet</p>
<p>of pine making (uncertain)</p>
<p>that one had nothing more </p>
<p>to enclose, likely</p>
