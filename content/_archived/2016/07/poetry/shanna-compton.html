<p>
Memorandum pink 
  the magnolias 
  are currently remembering 
  every last spring. </p>
<p>
Fog clung 
  as fog will do 
  to the hills over the river 
  in Owego. </p>
<p>
I kept wanting 
  to put an <em>s</em>&nbsp;in somewhere. 
  <em>I feel my mind&nbsp;</em>
  <em>like a buzzing hive</em>
  acrawl with cooperating bodies. </p>
<p>
<em>All the colors of the last weeks</em>
  bled into a single stream 
  of light from the headlamps. 
  Every river we've seen 
  the same river. </p>
<p>
I'm as <em>chipper</em><em>&nbsp;</em>as dime-store 
  but it's just as cheap. 
  I'm watching you 
  watch me &amp; wondering 
  how to pose, how best 
  to catch &amp; <em>beggar</em> 
  the brimming 
  of the river 
  alongside us.</p>
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Going sweet 
  at the sound of a certain 
  voice is a wrong 
  turn sometimes </p>
<p>
Let's wander 
  into the desert &amp; do 
  our best not to wander out again 
  until we've truly starved </p>
<p>
It won't take long </p>
<p>
We are very small 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fellow animals </p>
<p>
Do you remember 
  the pale then bright 
  yellows of spring 
  when those still came? </p>
<p>
Droplets of water 
  collected in patterns 
  on glass 
  when we still had glass 
  to keep them out? </p>
<p>
I remember </p>
<p>
Yet 
  the clear bald light 
  of the apocalypse 
  separates into rings 
  on the ice 
  too</p>
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Gelid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silver thaw 
  a gliding into sleep 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well that's for someone else </p>
<p>
I'm a word on your tongue 
  coined geologic ages ago: 
  <em>carboniferous</em></p>
<p>
Deaf like me 
  means I can hear even very 
  subtle shifts in you 
  &amp; sound has color the way shade 
  in the woods has scent 
  &amp; <em>dominant land vertebrates</em></p>
<p>
Innate &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>which branch are you</em>
  the person you are 
  standing upright 
  in a glaze event storm </p>
<p>
A body can be sufficient shelter 
  even at its weakest moments 
  <em>of atmospheric density</em></p>
<p>
Cruel pixels 
  your heart is in the right place 
  but no mountain &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no orbit farflung &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  no all-sucking collapsed star 
  could be more wrong </p>
<p>
You're an age 
  that must come to pass 
  <em>the heating of the plates</em>
  <em>the cooling &amp; drying of the climate</em></p>
<p>
Glaciations scar 
  every tissue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so 
  we'll grow them 
  new</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
This isn't how &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's supposed to work 
  &amp; play suspicion &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along golden edges </p>
<p>
To represent &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the journey 
  you'll need a stack &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of pages </p>
<p>
the time the trip took you &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plus 
  all the days you'll never &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;get back </p>
<p>
A blank in every socket 
  a locket on a chain &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;glowing </p>
<p>
at the edges &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in a shroud 
  of dark enamel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the corner </p>
<p>
the dresser speculates &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What 
  comes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tigereye at last </p>
<p>
coaxed open &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What agate center 
  of us &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rife with rhizomatic </p>
<p>
lily of the valley &nbsp; &nbsp; sweetly 
  scented &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; toxic </p>
<p>
the last thing 
  left&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
When is pleasure &nbsp; &nbsp; a pressure </p>
<p>
I've got a new gap &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in my line </p>
<p>
the way I feel things &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes instead </p>
<p>
of hearing them &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's not easy </p>
<p>
to explain &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speech is not remote </p>
<p>
but a solid thing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that slips &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>
&amp; you &amp; I are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;both receding into it </p>
<p>
into backlit space &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;frosted </p>
<p>
&amp; agleam &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;like galactic junk </p>
<p>
The pond once &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;teemed with us </p>
<p>
Alienation never knows &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whose pronouns to use </p>
<p>
We live under shame's grammar &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accent grave </p>
<p>
Yet dissenting &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like the new shoots </p>
<p>
that form in summer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from the barest </p>
<p>
green of spring &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so many buds </p>
<p>
no catastrophe's &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maxed out enough </p>
<p>to crush</p>
