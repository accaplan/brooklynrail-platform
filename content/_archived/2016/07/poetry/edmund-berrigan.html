<p>When it sank it thundered</p>
<p>Wonderful cries luggage</p>
<p>The dancing bustle of water</p>
<p>Exaggerate shoulder</p>
<p>Nothing for all your trouble but a bruised</p>
<p>Everything takes place</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old desk&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Deliver us from swivels</p>
<p>Lean outward, I can remember more</p>
<p>beyond this and that</p>
<p>Bands of distracted emotions snap</p>
<p>Your words will be guides</p>
<p>Is your beauty parlor</p>
<p>inquiring after you</p>
<p>You would die first, wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>Take off your games of chance</p>
<p>leading with his chin</p>
<p>The earth opens and swallows you</p>
<p>And the lights go out all over</p>
<p>the Flatiron building</p>
<p>which brings me to the part</p>
