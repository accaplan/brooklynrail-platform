<p>
See you soon America</p>
<p>
chronic
  obstructed
  pulmonary</p>
<p>
diseased</p>
<p>
Labors breath not left
  last walk on the moon
  not Mars
  not nothing
  not painting the sky
  nothing to Straw out a drink
  Since the Cotton Bail</p>
<p>
20th to last berth
  top as the boat list
  Silver or sugar of lead
  Light simple fresh
  Emurserate the pennies of migrants
  Dutch oven cooking nothing now
  we are that last
  thoughts to spend
  messaging insane stack out
  the purpose one's made</p>
<p>
Miles of conveyer feed</p>
<p>
back of bus stuck last steam
  Even without the bosons trouble</p>
<p>
Dropping retinas base
  The rabbi&rsquo;s letter to Shiva
  as the engine grows cold
  Seven more strokes
  Every one starts to buy bikini insurance
  Water on every state room floor
  No one wants to spend
  Pocket burst
  Last ticket
  Last steam</p>
<p>
All Aboard</p>
<p>
Catfish kick back sharks stalk the bottom 
  starve collecting metal plastic and the droppings of progress</p>
<p>
Shark attacks kickbacks catfish catch the bottom 
  grow large collecting metal plastic droppings of progress</p>
<p>
Heaven feet for 7 knows
  Flat seas
  better craftsmen breathe</p>
<p>
Flat song
  Flat song</p>
<p>
Flat song of us last steam</p>
<p>
Fare for free social is all
  Security it seems
  National debt not set
  Paddle Wheels
  worlds begging for water</p>
<p>
D VIL can't kill G&nbsp; D
  Nor would nature wish it did
  No patent on life
  Every slow beat and love letter comes from this delta reach
  Choke or no choke
  engine breathe last steam
  Power fail
  No choke
  Market bare
  Full choke
  Peace full here
  Don&rsquo;t choke
  Project stairs
  No choke
  Every where
  no choke</p>
<p>
Who said breathe America
  Un trained grey hound
  run back rabbit dam closed
  Left alone
  at the drain hole
  past the spill way
  Half the contract signed
  Other half at the stop gate</p>
<p>
That last fu cka le&nbsp; f ce
  That last f ckable fa e</p>
<p>
Played birth to burn and oh that nuclear fury</p>
<p>
under desk top slab sigh cover eye</p>
<p>
Harbinger hitch connects the bow to stern
  backwards ass grab
  Tickled friends the only ones that laugh</p>
<p>
Quiet cry on tenement
  top
  roof a last only protection from the rain
  Power push stolen from the street lamp</p>
<p>
Dinner cooked on begged time
  just one more hour to digest</p>
<p>
I'm hungry the youngest howls</p>
<p>
Tired fight another time Middle girl squeals</p>
<p>
the oldest cries wants memories to return</p>
<p>
Penny's back
  begs for the poor
  the more we stock
  fighting bear
  in settled bull</p>
<p>
Rain wash the compound from our deck
  Bows man hitch
  Buried sleep</p>
<p>
All aboard
  All aboard</p>
<p>
Last steam </p>
<p>
Motor steady getting ready to slip</p>
<p>
Last steam ship</p>
<p>
Not our vote
  counteract seconds left behind
  free for now
  Far less coal burn water breath
  Last Steam ship</p>
<p>
All aboard
  All aboard</p>
<p>
Sunday cycle
  home cold of conversation</p>
<p>
But the engine still burns
  Buried in thoughts of return
  betterment</p>
<p>
Puddles on stateroom floors
  Carpets in the galley wet
  again
  Last address
  The bands last note
  Unsettled left
  waitress free dessert</p>
<p>
Cooked deep in the fat of pertrloemn
  Choking deep in the flats of the desert
  Muh mad
  Trouble breathing Sky on the mountain 
  Bu dha
  Restricted air way in in the garden
  Je us</p>
<p>
And the 
  Tao
  not to breathe</p>
<p>
Nor a breath to catch
  Sh va</p>
<p>
rest ancients Here swallowing water
  Moi han</p>
<p>
last steam ship freedom</p>
<p>
All aboard</p>
<p>
reprieve and last repent
  Not to quit
  Last steam ship</p>
<p>
All aboard</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
All aboard</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
All aboard America
