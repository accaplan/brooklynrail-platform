title: One

<p>It&rsquo;s early in the year, early in the week, early in the day. </p>
<p>A man clips his fingernails on the L train.</p>
<p>I think about outrage at the public act of hygiene. I think, I've done worse. Done more damage than that with my thoughts. </p>
<p>I begin at the graveyard where the sun is low in the sky.</p>
<p>I put my things into the flatness where I can see them. </p>
<p>Here we are orange tractor someone's digging up a grave. </p>
<p>Like the word river spelled backwards, I fall into myself.</p>
<p>My histories have me in fits.</p>
<p>Another death by drowning dream. Another death by asphyxiation dream. Another death by public sex dream.</p>
<p>I dream my parents at a gas station. I fail to leave before they see me. I&rsquo;m wearing a very wet bathing suit. Somehow it&rsquo;s clear to everyone that I've been having sex. With lots of people. Young men with long eyelashes cross the street into the sun. I think: We're <em>not</em> all in this together. </p>
<p>Yesterday I was too stunned too sad too in a way feeling the sadness. Today I am too stunned too sad too in a way not feeling the sadness.</p>
<p>I participate in the whitest lock-down of collective wonder. </p>
<p>Seeing my fingers in the metal, I fear my fate is sealed. </p>
<p>I'm all those assholes. </p>
<p>Having things I don't want to be told to not have.</p>
<p>A thin rope in my back pocket, I am ready to strangle the truth out of anyone.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I try out a sentence to see whether I believe it: The labor of others is the fullness of my weekend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a dangerous receptacle with all this ego.</p>
<p>I have feelings of superiority. I'll make something of you if you listen closely. </p>
<p>I may not be strong enough to wrestle my symptoms. </p>
<p>I try out a sentence to see whether I believe it: You may not be strong enough to wrestle your whiteness. </p>
<p>When it is far too easy to apologize for a good intention gone astray. </p>
<p>When <em>just saying</em> is subordinate to <em>shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
<p>I am still unclear about pancakes and the appropriate amount to eat in one sitting. </p>
<p>I am still unclear about the difference between my symptoms and my privileges.</p>
<p>When I am tired I sit on public toilet bowls.</p>
<p>I have lost all my father&rsquo;s text messages on the Internet. </p>
<p>Dear dad, I'm having sex. On the Internet. </p>
<p>I am privately putting things in my holes. </p>
<p>I am publicly calling you out.</p>
<p>Dear internet, my father is rubbing his cock in Lubriderm.</p>
<p>Everyone keeps saying husband. </p>
<p>I say, father. </p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dear husband and our genitals,</p>
<p>We are ten days into the new year. </p>
<p>Is it too late to leave the conversation? </p>
<p>My lover puts the entirety of my foot into his mouth and fries leeks. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waking up to paternal etymologies, solving problems on the ice. </p>
<p>I want to eat the buttery carrots, the shag carpet, and the long road to the house. I want to do all of this without falling asleep on everyone's face. </p>
<p>There's some good on the individual level but not enough courage. </p>
<p>Dear Courage, I&rsquo;m crushed by fear of scarcity. </p>
<p>I keep a to do list on my phone. Go to the pine trees. Find water. Try harder.</p>
<p>My face is creased with all of you like a well-slept bird I want to eat. I know some to think me a heathen.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think there's an imageless sleep free of your long fingers.</p>
<p>And I mean, nutrition. </p>
<p>I imagine you seeing me see myself and like the dream says the you in the dream is me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I spend 17 dollars on two sweet potatoes, a dozen eggs, crimini mushrooms and a can of beer. </p>
<p>I have no plan but having nothing in the fridge feels wrong. I'm bored with my performances. </p>
<p>The cat-dog argument, the superiority of the drugless body, the one up, the who's your daddy, the tightrope &#150; </p>
<p>When I meet a man who has read more feminist theory than me, I&rsquo;m like FUCK.</p>
<p>A man who has read more feminist theory than me tells me I&rsquo;ll have to do more than not shave my armpits if I want my work to be radical.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to the new year sidewalk tree massacre.</p>
<p>I dream a large man trying to get to my pussy. My wonder and slight disgust of his cock. </p>
<p>The theory that every person in one&rsquo;s dream is actually the dreamer.</p>
<p>Sentimental men continue to scare the shit out of me.</p>
<p>No, I do not want to help them.</p>
<p>However I am a trooper for custom.</p>
<p>When a mans says without prompting <em>just because I'm a guy, doesn't mean I'm an idiot</em> I do not respond.</p>
<p>Suddenly I have systems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
