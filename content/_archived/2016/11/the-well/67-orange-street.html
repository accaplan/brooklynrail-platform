<p>All good bars tell a story. Harlem&rsquo;s 67 Orange Street does so literally, binding its drink menu within used books. Crack the spine to learn you are sitting in what used to be Almack&rsquo;s Dance Hall, established in the 1840s as one of the first black-owned bars in New York City. The former speakeasy, then in a neighborhood known for its &ldquo;dodgy gangsters and dangerous liaisons,&rdquo; was a place where, according to drink-menu prose, &ldquo;couples drowned in the syncopatic tunes of a newly emerging jazz-infused rhythm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betting on the digital generation&rsquo;s nostalgia for speakeasies, 67 Orange Street pays tribute to its former tenants with pricey craft cocktails. Fine, the bartender is wearing a brown plaid fedora, suspenders, a bowtie, and pouring $16 drinks, but he&rsquo;s also hugging regulars and gifting newbies crisp, green apple shots, saying only &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favorite&rdquo; by way of explanation. The Color Purple&#151;Plymouth London Gin, St. Germain, lemon&#151;was actually the color plum, with blackberries and lavender bitters leading a sweetly herbal thrust. The cigar-smoked Woodford bourbon in the Manhattan After Dark was smoky, as promised, with the suggestion of sweetness by way of ginger liqueur and a brandy-soaked cherry. &ldquo;So this is what it&rsquo;s <em>supposed</em> to taste like,&rdquo; remarked a companion, after sipping a negroni. Parmesan fries and buffalo wings, though perfectly tasty, never obstructed the main act; this is drinks with a side of food. </p>
<p>At 9 o&rsquo;clock on a recent Friday, a maroon velvet curtain stretched over the rain-splattered, street-level windows, giving the bar the inward-facing secret of a clubhouse. Against an exposed brick wall, two celebratory groups of women chatted under colorful paintings for sale by artist Ruthy Valdez; mystical, surrealist images of female protagonists. In lieu of old-school funk blared the discography of Kanye West, whose lyrics the staff mouthed with vigor. At one point our waitress, who donned a delicately-beaded headpiece, directed her phone towards the craftsmanship of the bartender, who muddled berries, smacked mint, and flamed lemon peels. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Facebook Live,&rdquo; she proclaimed. &ldquo;I like to show my family in Florida what I do at work.&rdquo; By then, the music had progressed to Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz&rsquo;s 1997 single &ldquo;Deja Vu (Uptown Baby).&rdquo; It was the first time in hours that I was reminded how far I was from Brooklyn.&nbsp; </p>
