Anne Carson
<em>Float </em>
(Knopf, 2016) </strong></p>

<p>Anne Carson&rsquo;s <em>Float</em> flirts with the genre of the artist&rsquo;s book just as did her somber, brilliant <em>Nox</em> and <em>Antigonick</em>, her collaborative edition (with illustrations by Bianca Stone) of Sophocles&rsquo;s <em>Antigone</em>. In <em>Float</em>, Carson disperses texts in twenty-three individual chapbooks that arrive in a plastic case reminiscent of a DVD collector&rsquo;s set. </p>

<p>There are poems, essays, and what amount to performance scripts on subjects familiar to readers of Carson&rsquo;s work but which still yield new insights here. Carson engages with the art of Francis Bacon, Yves Klein, Gordon Matta-Clark, and Roni Horn, as well as themes of grief, and silence, and translation, and more. </p>

<p>The chapbooks do not feel flimsy (though they are) so much as precious and portable. You can carry them around, open with both hands, like a score of music&#8212;what in French they call a <em>partition</em>. Each section is partitioned from the next, loose and floating in your hands like Carson&rsquo;s title suggests. A score is a partition, too, in the sense that it gives each of us our own part to read and to play&#8212;each our own part to lose or to find ourselves in the shuffle. In an essay on prophecy, Carson writes, &ldquo;The etymologist makes cuts that show Being as it floats inside things and how it floats and can it.&rdquo; In making these cuts visible and palpable to her readers, Carson has created her own work of phenomenal etymology, or what we might call prophecy. </p>
