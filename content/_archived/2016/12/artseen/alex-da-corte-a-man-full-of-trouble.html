<p>Arguably, Alex Da Corte has been one of the most prolific artists of his generation in the last two or so years. Between <em>Die Hexe</em>, his magnificent early 2015 occupation of the Upper East Side townhouse housing the blue-chip gallery Luxembourg &amp; Dayan, and his current return to New York with a solo exhibition at Maccarone this month, Da Corte has been productive. Earlier in March, Randy Kennedy of the <em>New York Times</em> used the expression &ldquo;post-post-Pop sensibility&rdquo; to characterize his first career survey that is still on view at Mass MoCA. Furthermore, <em>50 Wigs&#8212;</em>an exhibition juxtaposing artifacts Da Corte selected from Andy Warhol&rsquo;s personal belongings alongside his new sculptural work&#8212;opened at Herning Museum of Contemporary Art in Denmark this fall before <em>A Season in He&rsquo;ll&#8212;</em> Da Corte&rsquo;s first solo exhibition in L.A.&#8212;even closed its doors in September. Although the Philadelphia-based artist has delivered such an ample trajectory in recent years, his visual language and creative stimulus remain equally steady as proven by <em>A Man Full of Trouble</em>. </p>

<p>The namesake pre-Revolutionary War tavern residing in the heart of Philadelphia&rsquo;s historic district serves as a catalyst for the immersive and multi-faceted universe Da Corte builds within Maccarone&rsquo;s galleries. Slightly aloof, yet somewhat relatable, his installations perpetually employ familiar commercial objects, yet find their next sequence in this installment prevailed by a wall-to-wall carpet printed with the final scene of the 1963 Stanley Kramer comedy, <em>It&rsquo;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</em>, at the climax where all absurdity peaks and characters stare at the camera bewildered. Spread around the gallery, on the other hand, are a group of constructed hybrids of old and new, bizarre and familiar, and demure and kitsch. Take, for example, <em>Luncheon on Eye</em>, an installation composed of three types of chairs made from different woods, adorned by a generous array of commercial goods including a pair of online-purchased faux Yeezy PVC boots, a mini inflatable swan, and a thrift shop-found E.T. doll. Each component manifests Da Corte&rsquo;s personal aspirations and curiosities as a young queer artist born and raised under the cultural influence of consumerism. Laden with tightly interwoven autobiographical and collective narratives within their singular bodies, Da Corte&rsquo;s three-dimensional works overwhelm and allure, while encapsulating his associations with Philadelphia&#8212;not only the city where he currently lives and works, but also the home of the American Revolution. </p>

<p>Through the artist&rsquo;s treatment of variant objects, the audience is absorbed into a territory where notions of materiality, ownership, and remembrance blur. Rendering rather akin molds of association for each viewer&#8212;a teddy bear, a bowl of plastic fruits or a group of brooms&#8212;interrogate our methods for existence and memory. Trained to define ourselves through materialistic possessions, we, as the audience, feel compelled to diverge from that path for the sake of visiting a foreign territory ushered by familiar objects. What the artist considers personal or autobiographical begins to convey a collective subliminal narrative. In <em>Diamond Deal Pandemonium</em>, an advertisement sign Da Corte encounters everyday outside his studio pierces into the gallery in the form of a cylinder-shape sculpture accentuated by a pair of Kit-Cat clocks and a smiley moon on its rear. In <em>The Shadow</em>, an Ikea-bought loveseat transforms into an epitome of middle-class domestic angst, textured by a wire hanger and a knife holder atop, as well as wooden closet doors substituted for the couch&rsquo;s base. </p>

<p>Eschewal of conclusions runs deep for Da Corte, whose transformation of sleek objects into eccentric concoctions translates subjectively. Sculptures dispersed around Maccarone&rsquo;s spacious West Village post&#8212;each one demanding a full loop around its oscillating form&#8212;maintain fluidity, idiosyncrasy, and appeal, and are left open-ended for the onlooker&rsquo;s interpretation. Queer juxtapositions prevail all throughout the display infused in every detail, from the obvious&#8212;a miniature version of the Wicked Witch of the West, for example&#8212;to the oblique&#8212;a neon rose sculpture titled <em>The Last Living Rose</em>. The Yale MFA graduate&rsquo;s utilization of the queer, however, transpires organically through the embedded panache and ardor within each aesthetic composition. The gnarly paths of storytelling in Da Corte&rsquo;s orchestration are paved with doses of power, identity, desire, and most importantly, memory. </p>
