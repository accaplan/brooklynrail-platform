<p>&ldquo;The prophet is a realist of distances,&rdquo; said Flannery O&rsquo;Connor in 1960. In urging young fiction writers to grapple with the grotesque (O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s grotesque being a clash of the violent and the comic) she went on: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a matter of seeing near things with their extensions of meaning and thus of seeing far things close up.&rdquo; In the decades since, the photographs of fellow southerner William Eggleston have offered a similarly saturated irony; in <em>The Democratic Forest</em>, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s axiom of realism reverberates off the walls. Through the lens of Eggleston&rsquo;s sensuous, radical color, the things that seemed so distant at the time&#8212;most poignantly, the fragility of the American Dream&#8212;were very close indeed.</p>

<p>At David Zwirner today, Eggleston&rsquo;s images are the epitome of the Southern Baroque: dazzling on the surface, splintered underneath. In one photograph, a landscaped swimming pool sits squarely in a sparsely populated parking lot, a mother sunbathing across from the family Buick; in another, a shimmering, turquoise picnic table casts shadows on impossibly green Astroturf, the jewel-toned brilliance only highlighting the artificiality beneath. Aside from one striking instance (a portrait of the photographer&rsquo;s son, Winston, modestly reading a glossy advertisement for handguns), this collection includes images largely devoid of people. Rather, the tools and remnants of daily life stand in for human pathos: table-top condiments, tobacco stands, a nightgown dangling on a clothing line, a telephone un-hooked. Each image pulsates with novelistic intrigue, echoing Eudora Welty&rsquo;s original introduction: &ldquo;pure human nature proves itself in likely or unlikely places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the exhibition&rsquo;s companion publication, <em>The Democratic Forest: Selected Works</em>, the photographic pairings are rich and harmonious. Early in the book, three silk-white candles&#8212;now extinguished&#8212;rest within a candlestick embellished with crystals. Across the page, a bowl of peaches and figs, too voluptuous to eat, are placed against gorgeously aged mahogany floor boards. A Delta still life by way of 17th-century Haarlem, the iconography of the genre still rings true: fertility, indulgence, sacrifice. And still, in the photographer&rsquo;s unforgiving jest, a turn of the page reveals a basement laundry room with an erect, mint-green Hoover vacuum atop an expanse of mauve carpet. </p>

<p>Yet prophets, to borrow O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s terminology, are always persecuted. In 1976, when curator John Szarkowski hung <em>Color Photographs by William Eggleston</em> as the first color fine art photography exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, it was scandalous. (&ldquo;Color photography is <em>vulgar</em>,&rdquo; Walker Evans famously quipped.) Set in fiery reds and luscious blues, Eggleston&rsquo;s pictures of his Mississippian towns and their inhabitants disarmed critics, who were quick to label the work &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; and &ldquo;banal.&rdquo; </p>

<p>At the time, it was the smoldering color that sparked outrage, but even today, his pictures leave one with an arresting inarticulateness. &ldquo;The only thing one can do is really look at the damn things,&rdquo; the photographer, now seventy-seven, recently told Augusten Burroughs. Perhaps this is because his pictures seem to well up from the soul, like a haunting, from a place with no shortage of ghosts. &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor wrote a few paragraphs later, &ldquo;can be very fierce and instructive.&rdquo; </p>
