title: 'I Thought That We Were Winning: In Remembrance of Leonard Cohen'
---

<p>Near the end of James Joyce&rsquo;s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, Stephen Dedalus is explaining to his friend Cranly that he is leaving the Catholic church. Cranly asks if he intends to become a Protestant. Dedalus responds, &ldquo;What kind of liberation would that be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which is illogical and incoherent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard Cohen died last month. His work, like Joyce&rsquo;s, is informed by a deep religious sensibility&#8212;by the believer&rsquo;s rapture and the apostate&rsquo;s profound sense of loss. Where Joyce&rsquo;s religion is logical and coherent, Cohen&rsquo;s is beautiful and terrible. Departing from the faith is as painful as it is freeing.</p>

<p>Cohen&rsquo;s first record, <em>Songs of Leonard Cohen</em>, came out in 1967, when the singer was thirty-three years old&#8212;his Christ year, as Henry Miller would&rsquo;ve put it. <em>Songs from a Room</em> came two years later. In the midst of the Vietnam War, Cohen addressed the moral bankruptcy of those leading the war effort. In &ldquo;Story of Isaac,&rdquo; he sang:</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">You who build the altars now</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">To sacrifice these children</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">You must not do it anymore</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">A scheme is not a vision </p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">And you never have been tempted by a demon or a god</p>

<p>Cohen&rsquo;s conception of religion is cruel and awful, and the story of Isaac as he has told it in the preceding verses is harrowing. Abraham is a brute, his authority unquestionable. But despite its violence, the story has meaning&#8212;&ldquo;my father&rsquo;s hand was trembling / With the beauty of the Word&rdquo;&#8212;a stark contrast from the senseless slaughter perpetrated by those addressed in the last verse. Nor does Cohen spare those opposed to the war, singing, &ldquo;And if you call me brother now / Forgive me if I inquire / Just according to whose plan?&rdquo; The song ends with an ironic evocation of the peacock, a symbol of immortality. &ldquo;Have mercy on our uniform / Man of peace or man of war / The peacock spreads his fan.&rdquo; Left or right, &ldquo;man of peace or man of war,&rdquo; everyone exists now on the same plane of unmeaning.</p>

<p>I grew up in Georgia, reared in a Methodism oppressive not for the fire-and-brimstone rhetoric associated with Southern Christianity, but for its suburban blandness. For me, Cohen&rsquo;s lyrics provided a framework for respecting and understanding the church that I was leaving. You can&rsquo;t question a faith grounded, as my parents&rsquo; was, more in manners and social ritual than actual doctrine. What Cranly says to Dedalus&#8212;&ldquo;It is a curious thing&#8230; how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelieve&rdquo;&#8212;applied to me only after leaving. I learned more about the Bible as an apostate than as a believer. </p>

<p>I was in Georgia when Leonard Cohen died. It was two days after Donald Trump was elected president. Years from now, when we remember Cohen&rsquo;s life, I can only hope that this fact won&rsquo;t even merit a footnote. Still, when I heard the news I was having dinner with friends, discussing the election. I thought of the song &ldquo;The Old Revolution,&rdquo; also on <em>Songs from a Room.</em> Cohen&rsquo;s narrator seems to be a disillusioned Christ figure:</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">I fought in the old revolution</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">On the side of the Ghost and the King</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">Of course I was very young, and I thought that we were winning</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">I can&rsquo;t pretend I still feel very much like singing</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">As they carry the bodies away</p>

<p>In that first moment, the sadness I felt at Cohen&rsquo;s death became intertwined with my sadness following the election. After eight years of gradual change for the better, I thought we would continue on a path towards justice. Like Cohen&rsquo;s narrator, I thought that we were winning. </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Old Revolution&rdquo; has a two line refrain: &ldquo;Into this furnace I ask you now to venture / You whom I cannot betray.&rdquo; Here, in succinct terms, is the concept of the logical and coherent absurdity&#8212;the idea that your death in the name of the Lord is not betrayal, but fulfillment. Reason can&rsquo;t grasp such an idea; it requires faith.</p>

<p>When I think about this concept now, I can&rsquo;t help, given recent events, but think of it in the context of government. When I hear Barack Obama speak of the United States, I sense this degree of faith in the idea of the country. Obama&rsquo;s faith is not na&#239;ve. The first black president, living in an executive mansion built by slaves, Obama&rsquo;s vision of America is that of a man who knows the country&rsquo;s flaws far more intimately than I can, and who views his achievements, which surpass most anyone else&rsquo;s, as being his not in spite of America but because of it. It is a belief in an America that is imperfect but redeemable, a vision both beautiful and terrible.</p>

<p>In electing Donald Trump president, we have exchanged that vision for a scheme. In the face of such self-serving nihilism we are left with the option of either upholding Obama&rsquo;s vision or abandoning the vision for one more radically opposed. The former course means the absurdity of acknowledging Trump&rsquo;s presidency as legitimate even as we resist him at every turn. The latter means we risk ending up on the same plane of unmeaning. </p>

<p>The most stark and powerful song on <em>Songs from a Room</em> is &ldquo;The Butcher.&rdquo; A simple blues, the song features a Job-like narrator arguing with an allegorical God figure, the butcher of the title. When the narrator questions his cruelty, the butcher replies, like the whirlwind answering Job, &ldquo;I go round and round / And you, you are my only child.&rdquo; The butcher&rsquo;s world is cruel but all-encompassing; the narrator is part of it. And yet the song ends on a note of freedom. The butcher&rsquo;s order is passing away: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m broken down / From a recent fall.&rdquo; The narrator, like Stephen Dedalus at the end of <em>Portrait</em>, is liberated. &ldquo;Lead on, my son,&rdquo; the butcher tells him. &ldquo;It is your world.&rdquo; </p>
