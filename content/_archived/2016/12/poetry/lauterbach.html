<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Stale bondage: history&rsquo;s messed up parade <br>
  of the undone. Nor dare<br>
  locute after the fact&rsquo;s act, nor say, having told. Old<br>
  unmerciful conditions speeding &nbsp;inkjet<br>
  gloss rammed down the starving throats of </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
children. &nbsp;<em>Children</em>: a sign, not pointing, <em>children</em>.<br>
  Blast of bright color from nature&rsquo;s pile.<br>
  As if evidence could return to be newly <br>
  considered, appraisals gathered for a final auction<br>
  under the golden tent. Stale bondage. Mistrial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
