My Fellow Americans, it is time to stand up and be counted
To take back what is rightfully ours, we must rigorously patrol 
Our borders, control those entering our country and our bathrooms
Determine what women can and cannot do with their bodies
This is only just the beginning, but at least it&#146;s a start
Because it is time to clean up the mess others have made
To straighten out the clouds so their purity shines down on us
For too long we have watched our rights eroded by those who claim 
To believe in freedom, and that&#146;s wrong, very, very wrong. 
There is no freedom except the ones you earn and many have not earned it
This is why each of us must start wearing a GPS device
So that we might be informed of where you are and who you are with
To know if you are truly safe or not, because we need to keep track of those 
Who threaten our way of life, believe in a God that has no approval ratings
