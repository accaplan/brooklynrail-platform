<p>For a long time, we humans have tried to distinguish ourselves from monsters. <em>The Wonders of the East, </em>an Old English precursor to the medieval bestiary, is a catalogue of creatures thought to inhabit Africa and Asia. Inside, ants are as big as dogs, serpents have two heads, and people are &ldquo;born of three colors.&rdquo; The text survives as a record of how Anglo-Saxons coped with the slippage between human and nonhuman, self and other. They cooked up fictions. </p>

<p><em>Bestiary</em>, Donika Kelly&rsquo;s first book of poetry, upends the warrants of the tradition it&rsquo;s named after. Here, the speaker&rsquo;s journey is psychological in nature&#8212;and the monsters she meets are all her own. Between poems titled &ldquo;Out West&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back East,&rdquo; she comes face to face with griffons and whales, mermaids and werewolves. Hers is a trip of a lifetime, a quest to track down her truest self. </p>

<p> &ldquo;Out West,&rdquo; the first poem in the collection, tells us how it wants to be read. It begins with a series of directives: &ldquo;Refuse the old means of measurement. / Rely instead on the thrumming / wilderness of the self. Listen.&rdquo; The &ldquo;you&rdquo; implied here might be the reader or an alternate version of the speaker, but either way the message is the same: inherited maps and hierarchies are not to be trusted; we are to take stock of our own natures instead. When we do so, we discover a psychic &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; that always existed. &ldquo;Sheep and brown cows / / graze your heart pocket. Antelope and bison/ lap the great lake of your eye. And your ear / the black bear winters.&rdquo; It turns out we are made up of all the beasts that we were taught to label &ldquo;less-than&rdquo; or &ldquo;other.&rdquo; So who are we to judge?</p>

<p> In the collection&rsquo;s introduction, Nikky Finney writes, &ldquo;<em>Bestiary</em> is a first book of poems by an all Black girl who teaches us nothing is all black, or all female, or all male, or all belonging to humans, or all tidy.&rdquo; In these poems, hybridity&#8212;and our denial of it&#8212;is a working definition of human nature. We are always more complicated than representation suggests. In &ldquo;Catalogue,&rdquo; the speaker considers this conundrum. &ldquo;All of America is inside you, a catalogue of lives and land / and burrowing things,&rdquo; Kelly writes. But a &ldquo;catalogue of lives and land / and burrowing things&rdquo; is almost nonsense, a mixture that doesn&rsquo;t mix. How, then, to identify? Naming &ldquo;you&rdquo; is reductive, violent: &ldquo;You think / about the art of holding, / of being held. This hand can crush you.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In <em>Bestiary, </em>Kelly does not &ldquo;crush&rdquo; or resolve her contradictions. Instead, she tracks down her constituent personas and puts them in conversation. Even her titles, like &ldquo;Self-Portrait as a Block of Ice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Self-Portrait as a Door,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Self-Portrait as a Wooden Flower,&rdquo; trouble the notion of a singular self. In &ldquo;Self-Portrait as a Door,&rdquo; the speaker digs into what identifying as a door means, exactly: &ldquo;You are a sign / are a plank are a raft are a felled oak. / You are a handle are a turn are a bit of brass lovingly polished.&rdquo; The speaker breaks the door into its constituent parts and puzzles over their relative importance. What makes a door a door? A woman a woman? This process would seem abstract if it weren&rsquo;t so personal.</p>

<p>Kelly&rsquo;s speaker imagines alternate personas partly to escape her own story. &ldquo;Fourth Grade Autobiography,&rdquo; for instance, adopts a child&rsquo;s point of view: &ldquo;We live in Lost Angeles, California. / We have a front yard and a backyard. / My favorite things are cartwheels, salted plums, and playing catch with my dad,&rdquo; the poem begins. But the innocence of these lines feels canned, like a story a child tries to repeat into truth. In &ldquo;How to be alone,&rdquo; the collection&rsquo;s longest poem, this innocence implodes, as the speaker recalls memories of sexual abuse. &ldquo;The gusset of your panties / soaked with your father&rsquo;s semen. Why he / deserves every arc of your boot. Why / the door is always locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To survive this trauma, the speaker tries to understand it, to pinpoint its effects. How has it shaped her? Who would she have been otherwise? &ldquo;Archaeology,&rdquo; a poem with white space in the middle of line, gets at the mootness of these questions. The speaker struggles to weed out the imposter from her multitudes.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">More and moreI find the image of my father</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">in my own facean emptiness behind the eyes</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">I am unable to movethe ore in my blood</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">slurried and slowthe sun bruising the sky</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">in its slow dragI am dragging his face</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">out of my own.</p>

<p>Again, Kelly turns to the imagery of a body that is split, divided. But here, multiplicity is not freedom&#8212;it&rsquo;s occupation. There is no distinguishing the speaker and her abuser. To cut out &ldquo;his face,&rdquo; she risks butchering her own. Her father is only &ldquo;more and more&rdquo; a part of her.</p>

<p>As readers, we want the speaker to be okay; we want art to compensate for life. But Kelly doesn&rsquo;t lie. Instead, she shares her experience. In &ldquo;Love Poem: Chimera,&rdquo; for instance, the reader seems to be part of the speaker&rsquo;s body or derived from it. Here, use of the second person fast-tracks empathy and encourages introspection.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">I thought myself lion and serpent. Thought</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">myself body enough for two, for we.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">Found comfort in never being lonely.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">What burst from my back, from my bones, what lived</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">Along the ridge from crown to crown, from mane</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">To forked tongue beneath the skin. What clamor</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">We made in the birthing. What hiss and rumble</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">At the splitting, at the horns and beard,</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">At the glottal bleat. What bridges our back.</p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">What strong neck, what bright eye. What menagerie </p>

<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px;margin-top:-1.5em;">are we. What we&rsquo;ve made for ourselves. </p>

<p>Through the second person plural, the speaker implicates us in the process of violence and rebirth. Each of these triumphant exclamations (&ldquo;What menagerie / are we. What we&rsquo;ve made for ourselves) doubles as a question, a cue to begin our own research. Kelly implores us to unlock our inner-monsters, to let them romp about.</p>

<p><em>Bestiary </em>is an emotionally intense debut by a poet whose ambition is to unmake our assumptions. We don&rsquo;t know whom Kelly is writing to or about&#8212;but, in the limbo between pronouns, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. Like a species in a bestiary, the boundaries between &ldquo;you,&rdquo; &ldquo;me,&rdquo; &ldquo;him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; are just inventions. With Kelly&rsquo;s poems, we evolve. </p>
