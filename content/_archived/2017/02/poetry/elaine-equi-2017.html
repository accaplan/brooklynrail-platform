<p>
SORRY, I DIDN&rsquo;T GET THAT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My iPad keeps coaxing me to ask it a question,
  but I refuse. I&rsquo;m not comfortable seeking advice
  from or giving orders to &#150; a what? A program?
  The class difference between us embarrasses me.
  I&rsquo;ve never had a secretary or a cleaning service.
  If I had sex with a robot, I would probably worry
  that I seem too mechanical.</p>

<p>
RIVER OF STUDENTS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Everything in my life seems vague and elusive, yet for the most part,
  my sense of impermanence has turned out to be rather solid.</p>
<p>
How else is it possible that for almost forty years I&rsquo;ve been teaching &#150; 
  sitting in any number of nondescript rooms, in front of blackboards
  I never write on, exchanging pleasantries with the students as if we were
  simply passing time by talking about books we happen to be reading.</p>
<p>
I think of all their names, the papers they&rsquo;ve handed me, the papers
  I&rsquo;ve handed back, and together we form a current &#150; a kind of river
  that has drawn me &#150; drawn us &#150; forward towards I&rsquo;m not sure what.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the larger ocean of language itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>
ALIVE WITH MYTH
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>for Vincent Katz</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A myth is more insistent
  than a rumor.</p>
<p>
It has a thick skin
  like the atmosphere
  of a planet.</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve known Saturn&rsquo;s
  cold shoulder.</p>
<p>
Neptune and Vulcan&rsquo;s
  deluge and volcano &#150;</p>
<p>
the watery fire
  of my father&rsquo;s temper
  meant to be.</p>
<p>
Giddy Venus.
  Jupiter, always ready
  to place a bet.</p>
<p>
Gemini&rsquo;s good and evil twins
  gadding about the forest </p>
<p>
one can enter from any country,
  any century -- spread out over time.</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve seen how these old gods operate,</p>
<p>
push and pull us
  this way and that.</p>
<p>
Though distant, they are not dead &#150;</p>
<p>
still whisper inaudible
  but unmistakable
  words of warning and good cheer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
ALCOVES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The poem keeps retreating
  further and further</p>
<p>
from global markets
  and technological progress.</p>
<p>
It claims to require
  more privacy --</p>
<p>
a certain semiotic
  vagrancy,</p>
<p>
grottos where its words
  can be enshrined</p>
<p>
in hermeneutic headdress 
  and opalescent ambiance.</p>
<p>
Backlit. Recessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
WHY?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I write to impersonate words and give them a more human quality.</p>
<p>
I write so I can taste test a word for myself.</p>
<p>
I write to discover what can only be said in the moment &#150; because it is &#150;
  no matter how stupid or obvious that sounds.</p>
<p>
I write because it&rsquo;s an inexpensive habit &#150; except in terms of time.</p>
<p>
I write because I can&rsquo;t sing.</p>
<p>
I write to embellish facts.</p>
<p>
I write to spite an old nun who punished me for telling the truth by having
  me write &ldquo;I will not tell lies&rdquo; one hundred times.</p>
<p>
I write because certain combinations of words really are magical.</p>
<p>
I write to create a body of work.</p>
<p>
I write to converse with the dead and pay my respects to the unborn.</p>
<p>
I write to procrastinate and avoid not writing.</p>
