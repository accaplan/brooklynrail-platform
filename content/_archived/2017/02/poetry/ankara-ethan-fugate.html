Photographer Burhan Ozbilici was present and documented the incident and aftermath. One of the photos he took is already, just days after the event, being described as iconic. </p>

Someone says it is
  one&nbsp;of the most beautiful 
  photographs the most 
  beautiful photographs most 
  beautiful photograph
  they&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
  
  <p>
It&rsquo;s hard to stay focused 
  I try to read marginalia 
  trying it&rsquo;s hard to read 
  edges the beautiful marginalia</p>
  
  <p>
Most photographs are not 
  in focus one hard attempt 
  to understand the news 
  characters counted between 
  letters the spaces made 
  by image I try hard 
  to stay beautiful</p>
<p>
The focus of characters
  in photographs difficult
  to try one of the most-read 
  attempts it&rsquo;s beautiful
  to attempt the marginalia
  like hard characters 
  glowing off the page 
  of illuminated scripts</p>
<p>
The left arm rigid index
  finger pointing toward 
  God a gun in the other 
  hand trigger-finger gold
  leaf in the other 
  background&nbsp;the body 
  becomes annotated</p>

The description</p>
  
  <p><em>&ldquo;One of the most beautiful photographs&rdquo; 
  </em></p>
  <p>
  containing thirty-six 
  characters 
  with spaces
  is the auto-
  correction of
  horror through
  composition 
  bringing form 
  forward while 
  truth empties 
  out from a body
  in the background
  pointed toward 
  God the image 
  an omnipotent 
  likeness fingers 
  glowing gun 
  glowing molten
  focus of rage
  We scribble 
  at the edge
  of what is seen 
  illuminated 
  by finger pointing 
  not difficult to see 
  and yet the phrase
  is repeated again
  and again edgewise</p>

What about those pictures
  hanging in the background 
  marginal witness to the crime
  the score for art set 
  to a smell of sulfur and iron 
  emptying from bodies
  these pictures out of focus
  glass shards across the floor
  hard to read easy to think about
  the mouth frozen in a shout
  the eyes emptying themselves
  of all marginalia making room 
  for a space to focus on a single
  violent act where the act 
  becomes marginal to the photo </p>

It&rsquo;s hard to hear these things
  hard to separate them into
  smaller pieces beautiful 
  in themselves tragic in themselves
  infuriating in themselves 
  each piece once detached 
  growing from a single bullet
  into an arsenal of truth emptying
  from the edges where faces
  covered in drying blood and dust
  peer up at the snowfall 
  of ash that never stops</p>
