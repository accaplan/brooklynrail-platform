<p>
Father cried 
  Only once
  When Mother, half-dead, mouthed
  I love you </p>
<p>
From her bed
  Brown and mossy, something 
  Brown and mossy also at the window
  Mouthing </p>
<p>
The moon 
  Divided by a poppy</p>
<p>
Missionaries mating with cattle hearts</p>
<p>
Bowels as lightsome 
  Children are fungus 
  Performances</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Window is becoming love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Men weep bubbles into their knees
  But only children see bubbles 
  Chastising men 
  With phlegm and tenderness</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Men appear to be made of cardboard
  Boys appear to be made of men
  Appearing to be made of cardboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Men appear to boys 
  In the form of sons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Cling to one another while
  Inextricable organs fight 
  Angelic solicitations 
  To water parties</p>
<p>
Boys who drink sodas with one face
  Eat breadfruits with one foot
  Groom each other with one tooth
  Body&rsquo;s grudging love makes fast </p>
<p>
Slide their hand all over each other
  Sit in each other&rsquo;s lap, hang their chin 
  Over each shoulder, never has there been such
  Tender touching of an elbow</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I like under-ordinary men
  With long, fibrous hairs
  Growing from brown moles
  On abbreviated chins, some say</p>
<p>
Long, fibrous hairs 
  Growing from brown moles
  On abbreviated chins
  Are a sign of wisdom, but</p>
<p>
Wisdom 
  Is extra-ordinary
  And a sign is not a show
  But relief from actuality </p>
<p>
Neither actual sign nor show nor actual wisdom
  The retention of one&rsquo;s dreams
  In the extra-ordinary growth of physical properties
  Including but not limited to </p>
<p>
The hairs on one&rsquo;s face
  If the face is wise
  Remain invisible, simultaneously
  The living force of genius</p>
<p>
Not the monument. The monument 
  Does not perpetuate. Life turns living force into 
  A handsome yet sterile survivor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If the long, fibrous hairs are supra-wisdom
  What&rsquo;s the system? 
  Destroyed 
  Or washed away </p>
<p>
I watch men watching me, red with betel cheeks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Gangs of gaseous spheres</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When an under-ordinary man looks up
  From the tumulus of his head 
  To see the apparition of a nurse</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Narcotized and nocturnal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Under-ordinary man, the longer you let it grow
  The wiser die 
  The ones around you
  In perdition</p>
<p>
Reflected in the stain, spreading beneath the wandering</p>
<p>
Stroke that
  Cuts it, keeps it growing</p>

<p>
A man with a guitar is speaking to foreigners about America
  I love America, the man says
  I love America, the man says 
  Again. He is not speaking of a place 
  He calls America
  But of a feeling he has
  He calls America, the love he has
  For the feeling</p>
<p>
A guitar slung over his shoulder</p>
<p>
Tender entertainment 
  Of a psychic</p>
<p>
Foreigners are Americans, love
  When the guitar is taken off
  To be played, or pretending
  The guitar is no longer being taken
  Off, is being played. Americans love
  To be the ambition 
  Of a song
  Where it can be a feeling
  And feelingly pretend
  To be listening </p>
<p>
To English
  Sepulchral humor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
No matter how</p>
<p>
The man flung himself, he was 
  The burden of his flight
  So hardened to the homeliness of 
  His instrument</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
He felt one</p>
<p>
String coming off, yet
  Rather than undoing</p>
<p>
Enlisted</p>
<p>
To be the sound 
  Of the nation
  He does not trust</p>
<p>
When he forgets that 
  He is home</p>
<p>
The guitar is taken off </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Every time the man starts speaking</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Men, imitation men
  Drink Taiwan and Bar 
  Through plastic straws</p>
<p>
Their feet are bound, penetrated
  By nearly imperceptible fish </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For characteristic men
  Rarely speak, entrust 
  Those whom 
  They neglect </p>
<p>
With what
  They have to say
  Nothing, more or less
  To them, anyone</p>
<p>
Round and buff, gathered
  About their heads fall 
  Forward speechless into
  The harbor</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Women in boats are full
  Of constitutional life, they move 
  Like there will be a horse </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Drag their children off</p>
<p>
Into the bloomless hills
  Luscious, hard</p>
<p>
To tell how old 
  The women are
  The same age as women</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Only daughters
  Coaching woman from a pattern
  Misrepresenting mothers
  Becoming-intransigent daughters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Mother raises above the neck 
  Emulsions of both sexes</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Dragon fruit 
  Cut open makes
  A bath
  In what bleeds out </p>
<p>
Whisk with what
  Crystallizes </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When cut open
  A confrontation with </p>
<p>
The developing embryo
  Every life
  A progressive masterpiece</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Is edible
  And can be defecated
  With masterful discretion 
  To continue</p>
<p>
The transition from 
  One expectation to
  Another more 
  Ostentatious and</p>
<p>
To be, to travel
  Live, to be
  Anywhere
  Inside indigestion </p>
<p>
Is creation, strangers&rsquo; bodies
  And faces make me think 
  Whichever strangers I am with
  Will be crushed </p>
<p>
Into my body and face
  My body and face into theirs
  Best I know them now
  And be prepared</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Who is the person?
  The one who suffers and 
  The ageless, anchoress, poet
  Compassion is </p>
<p>
Inscrutable 
  When not encasing an organism 
  In the primary function
  Of seeing its death </p>
<p>
Clearly, the earnest
  Ministry of minutes
  Ticking closer to the heart
  Paradoxically</p>
<p>
The heart hangs from
  The ass, obliterated 
  With the mass of 
  Haloed organs</p>
<p>
Furthermore
  Anything short 
  Of eating one 
  Another is the squandering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Poets of suffering, versus 
  Suffering makes everyone adolescent</p>
<p>
Less than wakeful
  In the attitude of wakefulness
  The outside of one&rsquo;s enigma
  Asked for by the powers</p>
<p>
Like when my friend Leah saw me
  Looking especially exhausted, she said
  If you are very tired, you 
  Become literature</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

Elaine is in ninth grade. She is afraid of going bald
  But has more hair than all her classmates&nbsp;&nbsp; LIGHTNING IS 
  WHITE SWORDS, she says&nbsp;&nbsp; that
  Men are good at 
  Cutting things to the ground
  While half of what they cut 
  Remains above&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The ground, and grows 
  An ogre&nbsp;&nbsp; To be different, men 
  Remove more and more of everything, until
  There is nothing left
  But women</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
One thousand 
  Bodhisattvas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Upon a mountain, facing the ocean
  Inhuman therefore 
  Guiltless
  Exploitation</p>
<p>
One thousand bodhisattvas, gold
  And green, rotund
  Red faces with long black hair </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Beards blowing against
  Pink faces, exquisite 
  Bouffant yellow faces
  Obese and melting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Will marry god
  In a robe, contoured
  With shadows becoming a hole</p>
<p>
Androgyny 
  The secret pride
  The peasantry&rsquo;s</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>
Two million, eight hundred thousand people 
  Wearing t-shirts
  Doing calisthenics in the park
  Beating upon their asses with their fists </p>
<p>
Old women hip-hop dancing in matching tracksuits
  Old men waltzing, tiny boom box
  Young men hip-hop dancing 
  In front of mirrors, by escalators</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Old men and women slow dancing
  Do not make summer, during estrus</p>
<p>
Each right hand raised mid-chest palm out
  Each left held out mid-waist fingers down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A necklace filled with gasoline, a synthesis worn
  To be removed, and when
  Removed, the flesh in place
  Is always sudden</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>
Are you an author? I am a writer
  Do you write about Taiwan? I have never written about Taiwan
  Do you write the same things? The same things as what? 
  The same things all the time? </p>
<p>
What do you do in Taiwan? I teach writing to children
  Do you think I could also teach writing to children? I don&rsquo;t know 
  What it is you do. Do you 
  Teach writing to children? I could teach writing to children</p>
<p>
If all else fails
  All else will likely fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When I ask the children what they enjoy
  The children always say the same thing: Sleep! 
  To which I say, you should try writing in your sleep!
  As long as you are writing, it is okay
  To fall asleep, just keep your hand on the instrument!</p>

<p>
Some part of me is part of the poet
  Who walked with a rock into the river
  Everyone tried to keep the fish from eating the poet
  By throwing rice into the water</p>
<p>
The fish redoubled. They owned the river (as humans think)
  The poet&rsquo;s body was found twenty days later
  Weighed down with rocks 
  On the bed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Some fish ate some part of each poet 
  Gone down 
  Into the part of the fish 
  That forms </p>
<p>
An egg. Everyone ate it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
