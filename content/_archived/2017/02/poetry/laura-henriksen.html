So many love songs contain some 
  request to hear the speaker&rsquo;s name 
  from the beloved. Say my name 
  when no one is around you. Maybe
  it has to do with how easy it is
  to forget yourself when no one will
  remember you, when scholars won&rsquo;t
  catalogue your library years after your death.</p>
<p>
Strange winter night powers
  under the money light
  of stars and buildings,
  casting vibes on the nights 
  of all the people. I&rsquo;ll be around
  but like a burning sun from before
  a forgotten band was forgotten.
  Last night of camp, still time
  to fall in love. Sunlight in a 
  basement, name writ in water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

All night long I was thinking of fights
  I&rsquo;ve had with friends, a habit I maintain 
  to make sure I don&rsquo;t forgive anyone
  too completely. By morning I was asleep 
  and vengeful, a proud swinging
  lightbulb. John went for a walk
  and came back with breakfast and 
  flowers from the Campo de Fiori.
  At first I thought that meant Field of Fire,
  but actually it only means Field of Flowers. 
  There&rsquo;s a statue in the square of the 
  fifteenth century heretic Bruno 
  who was hanged on the spot 
  where they now set up tables 
  and sell food. I&rsquo;m never mad 
  at John, just everyone else. Spring 
  is coming, then summer, and we&rsquo;ll go
  see the Cyclones at the beach, like a room
  to age in. Every morning I wake up,
  and it&rsquo;s another day to take care of my body.
  Pack a lunch for it, wash and dress it, worry
  about gaining weight, feel ashamed about it.
  You can never take a vacation from it, but
  you can from work, so that&rsquo;s good. Tonight
  we&rsquo;ll go down the steps to the Tiber,
  walk along, and then slide in quietly. 
  We&rsquo;ll swim to the bottom, transformed 
  into Bernini dolphins. There will be many
  rocks and jewels, and to our great surprise,
  weird flowers. We&rsquo;ll come to a Field of Fire,
  all the fury of mammals will flow away, we&rsquo;ll 
  be immortalized as fountains in a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To never work, not even play 
  covers right, I wonder how 
  many sinking ships can I repose
  on at once? My personality, my art,
  my city, the world. That chest collapse 
  feeling of beauty. People talk about the 
  immortal life of artists, but I want to know, 
  first who gets it, and second, what the fuck
  good does it do? Devil horns on the beach.
  I&rsquo;ll live in a child building, take the stairs, 
  smell like the laundromat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A man on a bridge plays 
  an acoustic cover of
  &ldquo;Where Is The Love?&rdquo; 
  This is it. Carved in stone, 
  nothing can&rsquo;t get worse, or
  I&rsquo;ll be overlooking
  from a cypress top. Vines
  cover everything I touched
  on earth. The bells I tolled
  the waves I watched in 
  boredom and awe, 
  claustrophobic summers.
  I would be a bride in a
  square, a groove in a record,
  and still typically mortal.
  Burning heart, stretch it 
  out. Jump scares work too
  brings an LED tear to my eye
  little bird, all adults are obstacles.</p>
