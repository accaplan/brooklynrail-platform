<p>
But I had to help the mountain to save it.
  It did not seem to 
  hospital, or other human waste. See
  the sequence I've attached&#151;who touching it</p>
<p>
should dream. There was endless parking,
  a dribbled out orange stain,
  more waste on brave concrete
  where I sting beneath your tree. </p>
<p>
But I'm inside someone who is me. Demographically
  I'd mean, where no one rides for free. 
  It doesn't matter if he's dead. Or if he's beautiful
  or pain; this is the enclosure</p>
<p>
and it burns the mass inside. So that my yes-scored sentences
  are as practiced as the trees&#151;
  because to amuse yourself this way
  is to be permanently real. But this is not for reading, or touching</p>
<p>
going forth. Neither, if you will,
  for thrusting beneath clothes. Who touching you
  would sleep, and thus be carried off.
  Often there is nothing. No one but our love.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
First the belly is translated, then the yellow beak,
  the solid evil in the eyes, and the wings
  to take you up. Because if we act just right
  it is possible enough. If the opening is real</p>
<p>
through the bed scene on the screen. But without me 
  who is there, and to whom does it come home
  as you sit writing here to death
  hands clasped beneath my breath? </p>
<p>
The next possibility was extirpation all en masse, 
  while the weather gets all puff
  with the window and the cops. And later, moving in a swarm
  to the hideout overhead, the Mountain,</p>
<p>
dipped in fog, loomed throughout your blood.
  It is the mind of wind that does this. I stand in awe&#151;and wait.
  Beneath the sign <em>Utopia</em> in bleak athletic type.
  Because by then our feelings had been around a long time</p>
<p>
and there's a connection between them
  and what happened outdoors. You can weave them both shirts;
  you can live for the Sun. These wild rocks
  are your brothers. Incredible thoughts. </p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
Next we are given over to the words of the host;
  a bright bitter laughter, terrycloth masked
  as it emerges from the kitchen with Tuesday in its fist.
  You're the daughter in this dream, in the car named <em>Hot Escape&#151;</em></p>
<p>
but this<em> poem</em> deals with <em>our</em> <em>failure</em> to die
  and how the age still supports it, filling the yard.
  It just seeps as it builds, and is washed out to sea,
  the old silver sea&#151;which never was here. </p>
<p>
And who were we really&#151;just some organized space? 
  Sequence of tubes that repeated itself? All over the beach
  with musick and milk, big mammal eyes 
  when your partner bit back? But there's no answer now,</p>
<p>
it all turns back to stones, a too happy tree, 
  with more arms than we meant. So next time then
  I'll just come back as the Dad<em>, </em>and open the scene, to get still as an egg, 
  pierced by your star when you see yourself now, at the fridge </p>
<p>
where you stare and the password expired. Constant Survivor,
  your reach is really back&#151;projected then along all that 
  substantial life. Because it's the dead are pinned to life&#151;a petroleum based work.
  <em>Exalted ossifers. </em>When light came through the Earth.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus </em></p>
<p>
When pressing our hearts together on the dream carpet
  in the dream room because death, boss comes in
  in sullied t-shirt to furl. It's about to 
  beginning (but he's come from fucking)</p>
<p>
spellbound, enraptured (<em>dirty</em> <em>office</em> <em>fuck</em>). In the
  heart grief is pleasures, but boss is commands: 
  in that imposture of gestures the tableau begins.
  (Book an end with this walk. The basin <em>and</em> the rocks.)</p>
<p>
Then someone shouted. The appearance of this was a bright circle,
  somewhat somewhere near the ground, 
  slowly spreading towards us, traveling that ground.
  <em>Therefore that he may raise, the lord will throw you down</em></p>
<p>
where there is no world to take, save the pathos
  of each shape&#151;and of the shaping afternoon: it blanks us both both ways. 
  But <em>all this</em> (Dear Bringer) is now <em>yonder</em>
  up the butte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's right up there, glowing, it's the <em>distance</em></p>
<p>
<em>in</em> the <em>butte. </em>But for that your mind were late
  your eyes are late and warm
  and no one's really here,
  but the persistence. And it folds. </p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
But I still wouldn't say it's me who looks up
  in everlasting permission or that you've ever returned
  where you are a semblance to your skill set and death
  as red light touched the tips of the brick predicate. It's </p>
<p>
how we ritualized intent: when you're lifted 
  through the glare&#151;the sullen notes,
  the beat, the gusty warning bell, 
  though we have no right to states, which even now I do</p>
<p>
but am likely to repent of anything that stayed. So splotch on, 
  as you must, blotched illuminated thought, like a clump
  of heavy rain that has somehow caught the light. Diverge,
  fine spokes of light, and shadowed predicates,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
to live it out now with the Absence of Earth. 
  It's like a jelly made from pain. Anyhow, it's work
  to mood me into park where your sentence undulates. 
  But set out in yellow light </p>
<p>
I'm not even all that dead. Quiet eyes&#151;the rest&#151;
  it's all the math game gone by tent
  to east Oregon: the <em>past</em>, a perfect copy of the land. 
  But with all the panic of the meat; forgive us that you're next.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
And then how can I but to the chanting invite 
  the sunshine&#151;a hiss&#151;to push it all off
  and speed off into distance, then smell at the earth&#151;
  all the gallop of noon: it yielded life</p>
<p>
where loose characters drift in their old winter camps
  of wheat beef and pork&#151;to the haste, and you called.
  And of this pressure, the seats and the birds I was born
  to be sonambular waste, like nobody's time</p>
<p>
of anguish endurance and your brood of tough boys
  in oblivion tents, where the sound of tin falls.
  It showed you more pastures and rude little men 
  with steep telegraph hearts</p>
<p>
and the light hummed around.
  They called it Jackpot Alive&#151;while the charge is maintained
  but where does it live and 
  are you merely &ldquo;shoved in&rdquo;? Or do you carry that place</p>
<p>
to be predictably clear? 
  It would be a tedious task, like
  the worst town, or the world
  of experience told, if you get there at all. </p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
If you look on each day as a slave (you squeezer of money). 
  Don't. But if you don't. But if you left rationalism 
  and English teaching as if it didn't. 
  As if radical vagabonds, as if </p>
<p>
sleepless on tape, it's like your legs moved a little
  and that made no decision. Teaching 
  was just the teaching of this drink.
  Downtown, on the other hand</p>
<p>
was a good place to sit
  with luminous globs all over you. 
  Then the ferry horn, and the hurried passage back. 
  Then the middle of the harbor,</p>
<p>
then the voices flowing back. 
  The voluptuousness of this extraction
  awaits you. It unpacks you, Star Daddy. 
  But I'm doing the opposite. It's like when I go to college:</p>
<p>
continuous sleep. It happens continuous
  between me and my skin. So that after 3 seconds
  I just let it spill out: 
  <em>between me and me</em>. Let there be clouds. </p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Calamus</em></p>
<p>
Today revelation is civil war. 
  So now I'm rooting mainly for the plot. 
  Like (fingers asleep) for meaning. Is what he says.
  But touching each other in forgiveness</p>
<p>
<em>You</em> has not killed <em>Me </em>and <em>We</em> is consoled. 
  It's like a belief fence expressing thought densities
  or in-kind Disaster Suites.
  Because it's right that we be flames.</p>
<p>
Because I was the shoulder. But I was the legs.
  But you whistled on by 
  when you whizzed past my head. Less like a thief
  than to murder at the word</p>
<p>
and run for sheriff of itself&#151; 
  but the insanity of stars. It just pins you,&nbsp; 
  it all pins you. As if a great body,&nbsp; 
  God's ownmost solid cow, had struck</p>
<p>
my humble roof and vanished 
  leaving sound. Historically, I mean,
  or <em>actually: </em>today. But every time I rush outside, 
  each time there's nothing there. </p>
