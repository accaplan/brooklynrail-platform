title: Manhattan Meets Dixie

<p>I shut out the commotion at the other end of the long narrow table lined with my new in-laws. I chat with my sister-in-law across from me. I can hear my mother-in-law&rsquo;s voice over the din. </p>

<!--insert first image here-->


<p>My pork chops arrive. The family is served pot likker, crawfish dip, black eyed peas, fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, shrimp and grits, Hoppin&rsquo; John, dishes pulled out of a bad fairy tale. I&rsquo;m used to filet mignon, baked potato, green salad, New York cheesecake. They rave about Atlanta&rsquo;s Pittypat&rsquo;s Porch. They are introducing me to Southern cooking. </p>

<p>People are laughing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Miz Hamby! Miz Hamby!&rdquo; is bellowed from the other end of the table. &ldquo;MIZ HAMBY! MIZ HAMBY!&rdquo; </p>

<p>Most of the adult women around the table are &ldquo;Mrs. Hamby.&rdquo; </p>

<p>When the same voice screams &ldquo;DORIN! DORIN!&rdquo; I jerk my head around and see my new mother-in-law Sweetie glaring in my direction. Her eyes bulge in a hysterical stare and her mouth is open mid-scream. My husband hates her. She is loud and rude. She uses her soup spoon like a shovel digging up a grave. </p>

<p>Shocked, &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m irritated but I make myself smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you take your husband&rsquo;s name? Are you ashamed of him?&rdquo; </p>

<p>As a professional woman, I kept my first husband&rsquo;s last name after the divorce. I think of telling her, &ldquo;I publish under the name, it&rsquo;s my children&rsquo;s name and in the Second Wave, my consciousness was raised.&rdquo; Instead I look at the roof. </p>

<p>Hubert Fraker, Sweetie&rsquo;s fourth husband, has a scrawny chicken neck that sticks out of his heavy black winter coat. It&rsquo;s August and I wonder if anyone catches the double irony. He is sitting passively next to her. He is so cowed by Sweetie he never speaks, except to mutter &ldquo;Suit yourself.&rdquo; But she is <em>Mrs. Fraker</em>. </p>

<p>Sweetie is waving both arms. She looks like helicopter blades crashing into a lake. She knocks over her hot cup of pot likker into Hubert&rsquo;s lap. </p>

<p>I think I hear him say, &ldquo;Suit yourself.&rdquo; </p>
