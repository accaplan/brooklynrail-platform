<p align="center">Self-contained &ldquo;microcosm,&rdquo; illuminated on paper in<br />Pre-Eyckian splendor. Simultaneously mitigated by<br />Anomalous septa, debonair syncopation,<br />Place and space seem to migrate fluidly to unexpected orbits.</p>
<p align="center">In every instance, field and vehicle in image/sign are liberated to<br />Espouse and adapt to ever-more stimulating environments.<br />Like a spider building its orb web in early morning dew,<br />Using its body for measurements, moisture and air<br />Are caught in between the spiral thread.</p>
<p align="center">Walking, knotting, mapping, breathing with relaxed fingers<br />As if the intimate marginalia thrived on fluctuating between<br />Accretion and collapse.<br />Nihilism, automatism, manifolds dissimilar at will.<br />Precise and often homophonic rather than polyphonic,<br />He prefers to refer to the <em>Book of Hours</em> rather than<br />Setting the tiles of the Taj Mahal, which he did so long ago.</p>
<p align="center">I also see an inventive engineering that gave birth to this<br />Architectural stomping ground. Ribbed, corrugated and<br />Lamella vaults, parabolic arches, fluted shells,<br />Plus possibly fan-shaped buttresses that expand into massive forms<br />Yet they&rsquo;re always at the verge of becoming diminutive tapestries.<br />They&rsquo;re at the disposal of his particular devotional, visionary<br />And loving attentiveness to the atoms of Democritus.<br />Whoever gazes at this fearful symmetry,<br />Hasn&rsquo;t found his way out of the spider&rsquo;s hub.</p>
