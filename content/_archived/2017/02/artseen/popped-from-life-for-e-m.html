<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<p>
Leaping from a bent table into three-dimensional form,
She swiftly excavates a formidable void.
<span style="margin-left:100px;">Her key was fearlessness.</span> <br/>
A doorknob, hidden on the side above hip-height;
A surface anatomy that wraps once, twice, 
Three times. A mysterious tunnel lies below 
Her remarkable Jamesian depictions. <br/>
When <em>Things Fall Apart,</em> automatism teases the
Synthetic-structure-dance, ecstatic, with ease.
<span style="margin-left:100px;"><em>Whozat</em>! <em>For Which Way Out </em>please.</span>
Acrobatic things are tossed up, turned upside-down, 
<span style="margin-left:100px;">Twisted sideways. </span>
Compressed tissues build and erupt in the congested interior
Like Times Square&rsquo;s traffic at rush hours.<br/>
Her irrefutable brio tills 
The bricolage of tabletop and the soil of the windy city. <br/>
From a distance I hear her hypnotic sound of 
Cross-hatching on paper and the mixing of succulent earth pigments
On a cotton duck canvas. Forms cutout, punctured, stretched,
Popped from life not pop.<br/>
<em>Brick with Heart</em>, <em>Whozat </em>again<em>, </em>
Juggling comic sublime, 
Unpredictably masterful
Like a tightrope walker who prefers a surface of fizzy spumante 
Even on the coldest and darkest days of winter.
<span style="margin-left:100px;">She knew her chops. We all know it too.</span><br/>
I still remember between <em>The Sun and the Moon</em>
Muddy Waters and Mondrian doing the Boogaloo.
As for Ron Gorchov, Margrit Lewczuk, Carroll Dunham, 
<span style="margin-left:100px;">Who&rsquo;re gleefully shuffling their feet, </span>
With Suzanne McClelland, Yevgeniya Baras, James English Leary, Deb Kass,
And thousands of other admirers, the dance continues.
<span style="margin-left:100px;">Everybody knows.</span> </p>
