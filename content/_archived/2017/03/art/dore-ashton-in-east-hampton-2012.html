<p><em>In 2012 Nathlie Provosty and I visited Dore Ashton at her summer home in East Hampton. When we got back I tried to write down everything I could remember. Re-reading it now, after her passing on January 30, 2017, I&rsquo;m grateful for that sun-drenched memory. It&rsquo;s just a rough sketch, but hopefully it conveys some of her playful gravitas and blistering intelligence.</em></p>

<p>Dore&rsquo;s house in East Hampton is small and rough, sternly sensual&#8212;no nonsense. No air conditioning either. You enter through the kitchen door in the back. The rooms have low plywood ceilings. </p>

<p>We brought her yellow roses, cheese, and fruit. She had already set out lunch on the table&#8212;&ldquo;A cold lunch for a hot day,&rdquo; she said&#8212;potato salad, seaweed salad, chicken salad, and Brussels sprouts served in plastic containers from the deli.&#160;</p>

<p>She was reading Trollope&#8212;&ldquo;learning about Victorian manners.&rdquo; Normally she reads detective novels in the summer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised what you can learn from them.&rdquo; </p>

<p>All her life she&rsquo;s written fan letters to people and <em>never</em> sent one; but today she says, &ldquo;I might send one to this mystery writer who, as it turns out, lives in Sag Harbor, named Alan Furst.&rdquo; </p>

<p>But she <em>did</em> send <em>one</em>: in 1958 to Gaston Bachelard, after she read <em>The Poetics of Space, </em>which had come out while she was in Paris. She sent it by <em>pneumatique</em> to the publisher and got a letter back from Bachelard immediately: &ldquo;You can come any afternoon between 4:00 and 6:00.&rdquo; She brought <em>The Poetics of Space</em> back to New York, and is responsible for its English publication.&#160;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; most of her life was spent reading, though she also loves to tango.</p>

<p>I asked her how many times she has been in love. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I was in love with the first husband, Adja Yunkers. He snapped me up&#8212;a man twice my age&#8212;when I was eighteen years old, a girl who knew nothing of the world except for books, which was <em>all</em> I knew. It was almost <em>criminal</em> of him to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was really in love with my second husband, Matti. We met because there was a conference of writers from Europe in Washington D.C.&#8212;all people I was interested in, like Eco and so on. There was a tall man in a raincoat someone told me was an Israeli poet, Matti Megged. I went to talk to him and he asked, &lsquo;What are you doing for dinner tonight?&rsquo; We spent the whole night in my hotel room&#8212;we didn&rsquo;t have sex&#8212;even better, we talked about Dostoyevsky&#8212;which for me is the epitome of <em>erotic</em>. A real romance.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>Talking about Hannah Arendt and the recent biopic by Margarethe von Trotta, I said I hated how it portrayed her relationship with Heidegger. She responded, &ldquo;I always had sympathy for that story because when I was at the University of Wisconsin there was a German &#233;migr&#233; there named Hans Gerth who was teaching with C. Wright Mills, and he plucked me out almost immediately because I was young and luscious-looking. That&rsquo;s where I got my education&#8212;he would say &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you haven&rsquo;t read this!&rsquo; and I&rsquo;d run to the library and read it immediately.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>I asked about studying art history at Harvard. &ldquo;Well, I finished my master&rsquo;s degree in a year&#8212;I don&rsquo;t know how&#8212;I think they just wanted to be rid of me. I remember being called into the dean&rsquo;s office and being told, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re concerned. We never see you in the library on the weekends.&rsquo; <em>That&rsquo;s right</em>&#8212;because I was drinking gin and dancing with my boyfriend in New York! The business school boys would charge me five dollars less than the train to catch a ride with them into the city so I got a sense of what <em>those</em> types were like&#8212;and they were <em>raunchy</em>&#8212;sometimes I barely made it out of the car.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t a spectacular student. I got a lot of B&rsquo;s except for&#160;in Jakob Rosenberg&rsquo;s class, the Rembrandt scholar. He would take us to the Fogg Museum and pull out things for us to look at. I ran into him years later in the Louvre, and demurely walked up to him, even though I had already made a name for myself as a writer, and said, &lsquo;Hello&rsquo;. He said, &lsquo;Yes, I remember you&#8212;you were the only one who was really looking at the things I showed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We told her we stopped at Parrish Art Museum and saw an Esteban Vicente exhibition. &ldquo;I was the first to write about him,&rdquo; Dore said. &ldquo;And I thought they were interesting, but then they became flabby, boring paintings. He was a terrible person and I hate to say his personality triumphed in the paintings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After lunch we went to the small beach nearby where Dore always goes. None of us had our bathing suits so we just stripped down to our underwear. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Over there is the naked lady,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out here all the time. I have whole notebooks filled with sketches of the naked lady.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Dore in her white cotton bra and panties and huge straw hat, wading into the surf. </p>

<p>We all lay on the beach together, talking in the sun. The recent biography of Saul Steinberg came to mind, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Saul Steinberg <em>terrible</em> to women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I can tell you one thing from experience, he was <em>terrible</em> in bed, so it probably comes from that. Once he brought this blonde German girl to dinner at our house and she was going on, &lsquo;My family just threw some stones in the <em>Kristallnacht,</em> what&rsquo;s the big deal&#8230;&rsquo; So that gives you some sense of the power dynamics he was interested in sexually.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

<p>Before we left the beach, we talked about early memories. I said that as a child I tried to run away&#8212;not because I was unhappy, just because I wanted adventures. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I did too, twice, for exactly the same reason.&rdquo; </p>
