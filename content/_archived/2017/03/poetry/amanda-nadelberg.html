title: from There Have Been Some Days I Didn't Know Your Name

Closing abrupt windows I remember the
  Wind through the halls of synagogue
  The singing gods of Ward Street
  Nyunya is alive, also known as Function
  Ambassador, a kind title for dealing with
  Difficult people in a suburb of Boston. 
  Fire consumed a backyard of snappy
  Memories the couple had twice lost
  In the years I didn&rsquo;t know them. When&nbsp; 
  Story lays down the front door in a bed
  Made from desert flora, I met the
  Welcomed strangers in the deckled
  Dream of summary coats. Turning 
  The volume on its head to make room
  For dinner I heard the neighbor call 
  To her cat unkindly, a deciduous factor
  Of walls without insulation multiplied
  By the number of years that lived 
  Here. To record night as a series of 
  Fixed integrations left out for the moon
  To sun some, the beeping of the truck
  Waiting for its driver&rsquo;s return, no 
  Patience in the autumn of July, coming
  Home to a knocked drawer of summer
  Moving over our imagined limbs in 
  Concentric circles of thought. To see
  Uncertainty baste days in florid shock
  Convening for the wave echo&rsquo;s wave. </p>

<p>
Willing the instructions something 
  Muscles the way / We speak to people 
  I am talking about intuition, bravery,
  Embarrassment and awe, I am talking
  About a condition of senses.</p>
<p>
The less they tap one another 
  The more frightened they become 
  (The animals). Time presents itself in a 
  Chandelier of ideas on an international
  Trip in the 1980s. I was with family
  Staying at a nice hotel. The air hung 
  On. My sister calls and says she&rsquo;ll call 
  Again, my brother is buried in Lexington
  Under a house made of cans of tuna 
  And children, and his wife&rsquo;s things
  I call the operator to ask her how to 
  Spell words, this was then.</p>
<p>
A sign for a dog (lost) named Marco 
  I take to be a performance calling out
  The game under the guise of another
  Scene. The house appears the same
  And the robbers are inside, taking my
  Favorite turquoise, my machine, this
  Rude string. To take a self seriously
  I try not to invite cavities, the silver
  Dash of the workday, the plain job
  In a series of handshakes and hang-ups
  The laundry laid out on plains with 
  Ineffectual elegance. It&rsquo;s enough to
  Want the show and a different thing
  To put it on, walking the morning 
  Of Mexico and thinking of you 
  And TV programs we may or may
  Not see together. I page the day that
  Has become lost in its dimpled memory
  Signaling bandits (captured) outside the refrain.</p>

<p>
Without company I moved the natter
  Toward the street, checking the sound 
  Which the neighborhood provided ahead
  Of the screen it&rsquo;s almost the longest</p>
<p>
Day of the year, this particular year of
  Attention, a doorbell, a cauldron, a
  Cautious form of dream, the stable full
  Of streets and measured feet in all what 
  California could seem (a set of insistent
  Waves meeting at the station, a refrain
  For making dinner or decisions). Under
  Represented by a self in the workplace
  I keep carrying the weekend home in a
  Muted scene of summer, stammered light 
  A picture in itself. The uncomfortable </p>
<p>
Fortune of compassion shouting back 
  From a place near San Pablo (a stupid
  Motive five years ago) / What we heard 
  From the city was encouraging but also
  A banking violence, to turn lights on
  And off. Regardless of manners we 
  Ate something before the fires came 
  To summer in the hills. To know 
  It would be safe, a sky of imagined 
  Names marking season, mauve nights
  Coming because it had been dreamed 
  Before, a scene beyond the window 
  No one would believe if I told them 
  In pictures, congratulating ourselves
  For being witnesses though not deft
  Citizens. Form met me on the kitchen 
  Table, sweater rolled up to the bloody
  Elbows. I concocted a meal and forgot
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  My ending, changed planes in the room
  To jostle the state from what it was 
  To be becoming. (A song of cords without
  Upkeep, a bug on the rug.) The train&rsquo;s
  Sound distinctly Midwestern, a palace
  For the origins of memory, I put a bowl
  Beside the cup and waited for the horses
  To swim back. In dressed dreams they 
  Come to me fixed to an idea in June
  Delaying the means of day, but in sleep
  The clock appeared askew and I shouted 
  <em>I&rsquo;d like to solve the puzzle</em>. To begin (once
  Again) pour a pinecone over the mug&rsquo;s
  Contents and take the s&eacute;ance into the
  Parked shade. To weary of a thing 
  Implies intimate exposure and I 
  Wonder around the others in an 
  Echoed broom chass&eacute;, compiling artifacts
  And emotion, saying something regarding
  Introspection, which isn&rsquo;t the same as pulling
  Affection over my face in wild states 
  Of love. There lays a dance of pickled
  Thoughts I may not be able to say in 
  The daytime. To come under the spell of 
  sprites who bring me to where I will sing in the evening.</p>

<p>
Reminder: it&rsquo;s too much to know 
  The dumb rhythm of tomorrow when
  We live against the sea under a condition
  Of lopsided amnesty and since I work 
  For the capital I have a sense of blank
  Reward on my beak, the green of another
  Ground separating sheets of life. (When I 
  Set out I have a bag and the intention of
  Vegetables.) I aimed for the shaded side
  Of the street, said hello to strangers and
  To old friends who were now strangers
  And to acquaintances turned expectant
  Though I hadn&rsquo;t been certain of her state
  And didn&rsquo;t want to offend the shape, or feet. 
  When I was a room I relied on the window
  For story in a Romantic sense, which he
  Explained on one walk of the many that are</p>
<p>
Our hours when a person isn&rsquo;t in another
  Realm. To get used to something is to be
  Flawed at not knowing space in the months
  We stalk&#151;mutuality is all curses. I&rsquo;m on the
  Fence about this coat I picked up in the middle
  Of everything, the sound it makes, it&rsquo;s weight 
  Like an x-ray vest for rain. If love is for
  Maintaining the imagination, its firmament 
  Waves o&rsquo;er figures of loyalty and faith, the 
  Skipping needle each day two people are
  A set of silverware, a union of conscience
  And frivolity, a break in the stubborn echo
  Of the structure&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade. To call foul on day
  For breaking is to know the temporary fix
  Of time, its shutting off occasionally, cutting
  Oligarchs&rsquo; teeth on the pavement because 
  They&rsquo;re confused. Clarity was dug up centuries
  Ago by the Pipers of Algernon after crossing
  Famous seas / The collection winnows a self
  Articulated to no one in the artifice of this
  Bowl into which I sing. To wait for the same
  Community to catch up to decency would
  Require a different outfit altogether. No guns.</p>

<p>
Middling day I could say I nested 
  My identity or that I was happy 
  As a part-time person in the city
  I&rsquo;ve always been embarrassed
  Around people my age, waiting for 
  The floor to reach below the bell
  Rung for an occasion aside from
  Dinner. To have a diary is to be
  An incentivized outfit, our rhythm
  Ok but not perfect, which happens
  To be a caution for taste going 
  Into a third summer of wonder
  And kinship. (The backyard feels 
  Safe.) The second of two dresses
  On its way to a laboratory of minds 
  Thinking of the body, it looks like
  Fall in June, so in four months we
  Will have an answer toward function
  The bowl keeping up with its plumbed
  Hours, and by tomorrow I&rsquo;ll have 
  Lunch and a constitution and a bed
  To myself. It&rsquo;s enough to know 
  We don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>
Going into the room there was no 
  Protocol, to sit, turn, to squawk in 
  Communion with unnamable birds
  When the authorities are not now
  Working, when America is not
  Working. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To charge
  Us with knowing another, to pull
  A blade out from the hours under
  Which we sleep, impediments 
  Unto our own days of work collapsing 
  Play, understanding public apologies 
  As the greetings of today, these thugs 
  Of summer in state sponsored suits
  Rounding up the world with paper
  Cups, removing breakfast from 
  the valleys.</p>
