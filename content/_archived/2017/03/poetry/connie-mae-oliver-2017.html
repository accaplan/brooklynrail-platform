I leaf thru VANIDADES
  peeling open the perfume ads

<p>
Pastor Mallella came back to say
  Ashley and I can bring the pencils to his confirmation
  students now
  but we&rsquo;re crying
  we&rsquo;ve been copying
  our faces in the rectory machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Jesus is like a caterpillar in his chrysalis Pastor
  Mallela says flapping his arms in his grey
  two piece suit and his curly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
hair plastered to his forehead under red
  lights for a half 
  mile he rolls up 
  the window of the fourdoor Taurus </p>
<p>
we&rsquo;re so close like
  Taurus and Kia Sephia</p>
<p>
Pastor Mallella said meet me in GL
  what for? 
  To talk shit </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When I won a giant Shrek at the Dade County youth fair
  I took it home and named it Higher And Higher</p>
<p>
When Mallella ate the brownie from last time
  he drove in mad circles like in movies
  hanging out the driver&rsquo;s door and laughing
  on Krome Ave
  his curls grazing the lite grey street</p>
<p>
No eye contact with Ashley or
  we&rsquo;ll start up again 
  the __________ CD from Columbia House
  you can keep it
  you can keep it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Now&rsquo;i&rsquo;m alone
  like Aeon Flux 
  in the 20th floor ballet studio
  on 8th ave in a black sweater 
  talking on the Blackberry Curve skipping around</p>
<p>
Que todo saldr&aacute;
  todo saldr&aacute; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bien ya ver&aacute;s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; que si 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; que si que siiiiiiiiiii</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I say something</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Lettuce pray</em></p>
<p>
<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Already a subscriber
  you are my light
  my ethernet blinking blue</p>
<p>
Clueless Last Action Hero
  Stop Or My Mother Will Shoot
  the Sony cordless right out of my hand
  useless as it is without a pink line
  to wind about myself</p>
<p>
Bless you 
  four people say that:
  <em>Bless you!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
  when I sneeze once in political theory
  or environmental science lab</p>
<p>
Someone emerges on a balcony overhead
  and calls my names</p>
<p>
Someone pulls me up by the collar
  when I fall asleep in the GC lobby</p>
<p>
In art history someone named Lucas
  calls out everything,
  Prof. Chauncey begins to say this fresco
  is from&#151;<em>POMPEII!</em> 
  and Chauncey&rsquo;s like 
  thank you Lucas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To say what one is one 
  must say what one is not
  to assert one&rsquo;s image is to assert
  it on the world</p>
<p>
At the college I hear myself say something about the &ldquo;fabric&rdquo;
  of this or that and am amazed personally
  that I have for so long stood
  here
  saying things like this
  winding and winding</p>
<p>
When did we care
  about the sky
  every day we talk about it
  and how it changes
  &amp; say it&rsquo;s affecting us&nbsp; &amp; #mood</p>
<p>
When did we care so much even
  after mom said you know that
  one day you will not care like this
  the way you do now</p>
<p>
Agnosticism levels peak post-grad
  and when you don&rsquo;t appreciate
  being told your every excitement 
  is the holy ghost</p>
<p>
For all you know you are your own holy ghost:
  your own <em>a/s/l</em></p>
<p>
LOCO NEO THIS IS LOCO</p>
<p>
Leo died
  Leo died twice</p>
<p>
Ashley and I started a book club it was simple
  go blindly
  to the fiction section
  and pull whichever spine </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Not flimsy
  not weird</p>
<p>
Not Guantanamo
  not Bay</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When this new toothbrush wow compared
  to my old one
  it feels like 4 wheel drive</p>
<p>
You miss everything
  you even miss missing</p>
<p>
Remember Ctrl ?
  Remember Alt ?
  Remember Delete ?</p>
<p>
Who beats a game on Sega? Who does that
  I walk in and find you on level 29
  Sonic doing all this crazy shit
  and turning gold.</p>
<p>
If we talk about it we talk
  about oblivion
  detangling the power cord and inserting it
  feels Precambrian.</p>
<p>
Write into the radical vulnerability</p>
<p>
Help in the second avenue
  help in the third avenue
  help in the fifth</p>
<p>
Walking a kind of writing
  writing a kind of writing</p>
<p>
In the MET
  not saying
  one can&rsquo;t not say
  one can refrain from saying
  when one wants to say
  and one is told they&rsquo;ve fucked it up</p>
<p>
So then one is silent
  and one is told nevertheless to speak</p>
<p>
When did we forget
  Tim Allen
  and his way
  of improving
  homes</p>
<p>
I think about his mug shot
  in the Immaculate Conception
  church on 23 st</p>
<p>
and that the TV took him in&#151;</p>
<p>
who gets taken in by screens
  which confessions are /sin/ and
  who is dead before entering
  the booth. </p>
