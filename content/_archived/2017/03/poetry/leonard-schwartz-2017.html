title: Released From Within the Turned Up Cultures

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left:75px;">
<p>
Released from within the turned up cultures
  A toxin spreads through the body politic</p>
<p>
Causing the imagination to cease to propagate
  The imagination of even its barest condition.</p>
<p>
Doomsday ads and hooligan optimism
  Clog up the intersections and malls.</p>
<p>
It is we who interrupt the progress, by &ldquo;we&rdquo;
  I mean all these unaccounted-for graffiti and flyers.</p>
<p>
So many suns the significant sun
  Is lost in the glare</p>
<p>
And where its torrent of light falls
  Remains a mystery to you</p>
<p>
And the whole of your Nation.
  Fact blushes as crimson as fate.</p>
<p>
Those of us who are present must not
  Be afraid of the real and potential sorrows &#133;</p>
<p>
She&rsquo;s seriously ill,
  The parents know it now and</p>
<p>
All quasi-certitudes about the future
  Must be postponed.</p>
<p>
A pillow for the head
  Comes to represent</p>
<p>
The apex of culture&#133;
  And its nadir.</p>
<p>
Near a fir that glints
  In a moment&rsquo;s sun</p>
<p>
A strange animal is sighted
  Dying into air.</p>
<p>
And a ladder that relies
  Largely on feel</p>
<p>
When it comes to the question of&nbsp;
  Where it should extend itself&#133;</p>
<p>
Each rung brightly beckoning
  Once the decision is taken&#133;.</p>
<p>
Seasonal rhythms obscure
  The mineral joy of rushing water whatever season</p>
<p>
Trackless waste of a world without consent
  Consenting again to the kinetic.</p>
<p>
Or the mind is
  The most cosmopolitan region</p>
<p>
Of the body
  Except at the University of the Oblivious</p>
<p>
Where Time&rsquo;s mask slips from off the face
  Revealing an idiot grin</p>
<p>
Biting down exactly on its own
  Aspirations, self-esteem.</p>
<p>
Your life weeps inside you for the falling rain.
  A hermetic sack hardly seems credible.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You will excuse my calling so late&rdquo;, she begins.
  But her mind has atrophied, she says nothing further.</p>
<p>
Social order sickened by a self-identification
  That abandons all hope of its largest organ:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;The skin, in shine, not in shine, in shine again,
  Abed in reds and blues of our violent action.</p>
