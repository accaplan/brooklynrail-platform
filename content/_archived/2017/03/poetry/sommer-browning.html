<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Good Actors</p><br />
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I want to make a movie before I turn 41</p>
<p>
About two characters exchanging money.</p>
<p>
I give them directions. I say to them,&nbsp;<em>Earnestly</em>.</p>
<p>
They push the money into each other&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>
As if holding grilled cheeses.</p>
<p>
I call out,&nbsp;<em>Reluctantly</em>. They look down</p>
<p>
And say,&nbsp;<em>Goddamn it, this is the last time, Ray.</em></p>
<p>
And weave it between their fingers.</p>
<p>
They are good actors. So I say,</p>
<p>
<em>Hopefully</em>. They blink and gaze into their hands</p>
<p>
Like into a new baby.&nbsp;<em>Angrily</em>, I say. They gnaw</p>
<p>
The money to confetti. I tell them,</p>
<p>
<em>As if in mourning</em>. And the money sweats</p>
<p>
In their palms.&nbsp;And now,&nbsp;<em>Like a bank</em>.</p>
<p>
They grab it and throw it like garbage.</p>
<p>
<em>And a forest? Now a forest?</em>&nbsp;Like seed</p>
<p>
They sow it.&nbsp;<em>You&rsquo;re doing very well</em>, I say.</p>
<p>
They drop it at my feet. </p>
<p>
<em>Exuberantly</em>, I say. They remove their clothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>Lovingly</em>, I say. They move toward me.</p>
<p>
They are such good actors.</p>
<p>
They turn off the camera.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Historicity </p><br />
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Best ending to this story, Ben, is for me to finish the movie. </p>
<p>
Best ending to this story, Ben, is the thud of the script hitting your front porch when I deliver it to you. </p>
<p>
The drama of that thud 
  like the tomb closing, Ben, on Jesus, Ben, Jesus Christ, Ben, a few 
  days before he comes back, Ben, how Jesus came crawling </p>
<p>
back, Ben asking for forgiveness from his apostles, Ben, for calling them 
  addicts, Ben, for telling them how great they were, what good 
  mothers they were, Ben, how their careers were really gaining </p>
<p>
momentum, Ben, for telling them they were 
  his forever people, Ben, 
  and then calling them sociopaths, Ben. </p>
<p>
Forgiveness for that. </p>
<p>
Best ending to this story, Ben, is our movie winning that prize, Ben, 
  and me telling you and you having to say, <em>Thanks. Thanks for supplying the perfect ending to our story, </em></p>
<p>
<em>Sommer</em>,
  Ben, </p>
<p>
that&rsquo;s the best way to end this story and make the stars cum all over the galaxy, Ben,</p>
<p>
all over every fucking planet, Ben, watching cum streak through the atmosphere of some dead planet, Ben,
  &nbsp;
  watch it burn off in blurs, Ben, watch one seed escape and 
  land on that dry, rocky landscape, maybe Mars, Ben, maybe it 
  melts, Ben, 
  carbon, 
  Ben, 
  <em>making stains</em> all over the face of that planet, Ben, a seed, Ben, breaks 
  open and releases a blueprint, Ben, that cute 
  little tail sperm have, Ben, that potential energy, the stupid 
  spark of which the planet&rsquo;s lone molecule of Mars water has been dreaming, Ben, 
  that molecule looking up from its parched porch, into the forever black at the blue, so blue, blue Earth spinning and needy. 
  Ben. 
  Listen. 
  The water and the sperm fall in love and, 
  Ben, that&rsquo;s how babies are made, Ben, the baby roots, two into one, Ben, 
  it clutches the desiccated earth (but Mars), Ben, and wheezes itself upright into a cacophonous, impossible storm of scabs,
  it wheezes <em>Life</em>, 
  it says, <em>Life</em>, Ben, 
  Ben, it murmurs <em>Mercy</em>, 
  it says, <em>Mercy</em>, Ben, 
  Ben, it says, <em>We</em>, Ben, 
  Ben, it screams <em>We</em>.</p>
