<p style="font-size: 14pt;">The Corner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
People ascend the corner. They achieve it, and there display their sundry achievement, taking the turn to look at one another, in agreement perhaps, disdain, or simple interest. They see the future there, for an instant, and it carries them, though it instantly dissolves. The tedious surge of work, or painful thought of fun five days hence, brings their bones fatigue. When finally they leave the corner, it is with a deeper understanding.</p>

The limits one is inside&nbsp;
  Of, I thought there would
  Be none, for him there
  Were, but for me there
  Were, maybe smarter to
  Give up, but that's impossible
  With others, with self one</p>
<p>
For Lou, I love the
  Street, it's my place to
  Awake, and there is body
  Delicate clothing choice and chance
  To make it new each
  Day, a chance, he said
  A breath gulped, devour love
  At any interval, bequeath love</p>
<p>
Standing near the corner, watching
  The people pass, my people
  Your people, Lou, not underground
  Now, but up, up here
  Where everyone has a chance
  Today's a new day, see
  It, procure ways into connection
  Waiting for my living dream</p>

A smashing of glass, weighing
  Of elevators, pulse remitting cloth
  For poetry abounds in uselessness
  Pigeons flutter in light, dull
  Haze projects squeal, buzz of
  Work, steady walk, ripped edges
  Cat await smashed slab, dig
  Backyard, what would you call that?</p>
<p>
Hole, entrance, back window, forgotten
  Corner now project, and come
  To end, construction vast, but
  Not guitar, not sound of note,
  Voice contour to delicacy harsh
  Present, synch impossible pitch whip
  Down at my ballast, platform
  Long incline the price clarity</p>
<p>
Wired as music slow as
  Poetry, back to the road
  Avenue alerts that walking beauty
  Can exist, overcome falsity, what
  Do you believe, write in
  That delivery, of goods, anxious
  Claim to receive, no, obtain
  Thought to be given away</p>

When Friday comes around there
  Is work on the sidewalk
  When I start picking phrases
  Off the floor alert to
  Music in Friday's light I
  Have to make it, sound&nbsp;
  And it is alright whether
  In back or front pausing</p>
<p>
You are stretching away and
  Fame twists on a branch
  They had not that but
  Had their own, but all
  Had music, but few had
  Poetry, anyway, who knows, you&nbsp;
  Must project yourself into a
  Day, if that's a culture&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Too, so be it, if
  Not, so be that, but
  See that what you do
  Is something, a shot that
  Blows your day,&nbsp;now
  That I got you happy
  The human ring is holy
  Street people we all are&nbsp;</p>

It's all fantasy they make
  Their gamble on, she gives
  Of herself, like the poet
  Submerged in floss, today's a
  Holiday, how come we don't
  Get it off, how come they
  Stop, no encore, but they
  Played enough, we're almost deaf&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Morning, brightness blinds cold swell
  Emotion through wavers sink porthole
  Even to ascend the stage
  Inflict bliss endearing plinth lost
  Sound infected seam to inseam
  Blur headwind leverage press amass&nbsp;
  High-heel languor hang throb heavy
  Lift hushed wave brittle coast&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On the closet inspection bewildered
  Rock was wrench put to
  Groin full impact crushing ache
  Mordant sing arrest known portal
  Playable night phantom pattern tribe
  Eluct in echo contract style
  Again and again same sound
  Slight difference finds bells jackhammer&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Near the Corner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Near the corner, not in the middle of the block, is where the action coalesces, to be of street culture is not necessarily on the street. It all begins here, and you can see far and wide, people different ages walking to work, an older man looks up, a younger man strolls his baby, a crazy, aggressive, guy, stating, to any who'll listen, &quot;I'm going to end the Mafia! In three years it will not exist. Because it stinks!&quot; He's carrying a pillow under his arm and seems well-meaning, he's not offensive, but something went wrong somewhere. He needs help, more than a coffee and a kind word.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">The Smell of Someone Else&rsquo;s Sandwich</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The smell of someone else's sandwich, while annoying, is not enough to force one to get up from the metal table at which one is seated, in the wide, open, leaf-covered, space in front of the library, to move to another location. And in fact, one remembers the pact one made with oneself: to look at each person one sees and imagine giving that person a hug. You look at the young guy now, who has finished his sandwich, feel his aloneness, even if he himself does not feel it. He's on his phone, drinking a Sprite with a straw from a bright green can, and you give him a hug. </p>
