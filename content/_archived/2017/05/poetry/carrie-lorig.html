My beautiful friend J My beautiful body was here 
  My beautiful friend / My beautiful body&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;
  We sat on the back porch and looked out at the poetry farm The pecan trees are so new they are lime / green Who can bear it /</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
We talk about how it felt to wake up / 
  with blood coming out of the left side of my face 
  / We laugh / about me screaming 
  / about me being so filled with / 
  the changing earth / a dream to know / 
  that I had / opened myself / Stupidly or
  / Extravagantly <br/>
  When we stop laughing J / my beautiful friend / says, <em>What are you</em> /<em> writing? What are we</em> /<em> writing?&nbsp; </em>It&rsquo;s important / the questions put tenderly / and suddenly towards / the flayed flower <em>What kind of space does it take? </em>/ says B in a letter / <em>Are you still </em>/ <em>where you were living? </em>/ says B in a letter<em> Is the erratic punctuation missing or is it intentional </em>/ says the editor to the blood coming out of the left side of my face <em>Is it easy to forget</em> The word is a hard look that may go on  would have been the thing to say / to reply with / to move a hurt cardinal out of the road when before / you didn&rsquo;t / The word is a hard look that may go on / would have been the thing to say / but instead I said / I&rsquo;m writing The Blood Barn </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
/ I&rsquo;m writing / about my eating disorder / The one I had or have / To move a hurt cardinal out of the road when before / you didn&rsquo;t / The one I have </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
Eating disorder is a phrase / and not a word / it&rsquo;s a phrase that doesn&rsquo;t go on / I have a destiny / my death did not complete it / it makes SENTENCES These This couldn&rsquo;t understand how they came to be born An essay about distance and estrangement / An essay about learning how to speak / <em>What is a descendant of sensitivity</em></p>

<em>What turns the phrase that doesn&rsquo;t go on? What softens it?</em> I had a small amount of time left in England. I had been in the library for months. I had barely spoken to anyone for months. Everyday I showed the guard my empty pockets. Everyday I could only take pencils into the archive. I had a small amount of time left in England. A photo in the wind. A photo at Stonehenge shows excess / in my jeans / in the wind. I remember buying pumpkin seeds, barfi / a forest green diamond in East London. I remember buying a tent from a French girl. I remember buying a backpack from a French girl. The last of the money went / to a French girl and a bus. L agreed to go with me to Scotland, agreed to walk 96 miles with me on / The West Highland Way. We left excess, clothes and a suitcase, at a nightclub in North London. L had made friends with a singer who was born at a truck stop. He sang and gave us space for excess. A photo of me washing my clothes in a bathtub. A little bit of blood on a shirt. The excess in L&rsquo;s boots / made her walk bleed. Taking the route in this direction keeps the sun from a body&rsquo;s eyes. N texts me this morning, &ldquo;I hope there will be a whole series of books by women all called <em>The Hermit</em> that aren&rsquo;t explicitly linked,&rdquo; and I think, putting my hand or / the center of a flower / on pain, &ldquo;That is what it feels like to write this.&rdquo; I also think, &ldquo;That is the title of the body.&rdquo; <em>The Hermit</em> /<em> The Blood Barn</em> / the poem that gets seen and unseen again A swell A body not explicitly linked. The food stuck in its throat. We walked and I felt relief. It wasn&rsquo;t numbness / I felt nothing / but shape, the life of it. I ate but I had an explicit need / direction / an explicit movement across the silent comfort of difficult land, difficult animal. Cereal and peanut butter for the first time in months or years. Sleep on the ground and in the middle of sheep or cows. A boat in black water. A calmness about it, an envelopment. A night so cold we slept in the showers / of a campground. Red sky at night, sailor&rsquo;s delight Red sky in the morning, sailor&rsquo;s take warning, said the young man who handed us each a tall beer. I have always been disciplined. I have always been able to push the body that is also The Boiling Forest / my mind. I cut my hair so I could walk back and forth. I cut into my body so I could walk back and forth. I never thought I would write about this, about making this decision to walk and to cut. The great broken heart tucked in that was also not broken, but Blank and also opening. <em>What turns the phrase that doesn&rsquo;t go on? What softens it? </em>Bones and blood erupt <em>How is the memory of </em>/ <em>an eating disorder also part of </em>/<em> the red gate lurching.</em> The girl faces freedom and it is excruciating.Are shitting flowers / Is a phrase / Is a word that goes on / a typical intervention. Do they take us out or do they take us out. I cut my hair so I could walk back and forth. I cut into my body so I could walk back and forth. I walked to the edge of the mountain and went forward. I stood at the top of a mountain called Ben Nevis with the Germans I&rsquo;d met. I stood at the top and thought about what is both black and green about the mountain, a mountain or the shining body / of a thing that flies. They asked me what it felt like to come all this way without boots. </p>

I am deliberately watching the transcriptions from inside me /
  A bouquet of tulips trailing Rose-like / clusters I have known </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
this book since I was young / and this sentence: 
  Something about this writing is traitorous </p>

The first time I read from The Blood Barn /

while it could be unreal / crumpled Tulip 
  in a dream hole <em>Does it require belief?</em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">

I touch my odd gray skirt I can&rsquo;t gather it It is physically impossible I am not in my original state I thought it would be an essay / but in my life I&rsquo;ve never written prose/ 
  I described to N knowing / before I wrote poems / that I would never write poems / 
  <em>What are you</em> /<em> writing? What are we</em> /<em> writing? What kind of space</em> <em>does it take? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
A phrase that doesn&rsquo;t go on <em>What happened to the lyric?</em> These questions / my body 
  hurt A novel A woman / answering questions says, A sense of self that is already there. There&rsquo;s no language or mark for leaving a trace of it. Someone who is truly rooted in life isn&rsquo;t writing novels, a woman /asking questions says. She isn&rsquo;t writing novels but she is </p>

I am not in my original state //// </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;margin-left:200px;">
This will never look like a poem 
  / to you / or end </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
*<br/>
  I ran until my hip was nothing but scar tissue and a doctor / telling me to try eating butter / to try putting a vague feeling / or prayer at the end of this poem. My uneven body, a small curve in my spine / in my root I might never have felt except that I tried to run / to be a sentence / a word / a hard look that couldn&rsquo;t end / That is still here with My beautiful friend J My beautiful body was here My beautiful friend / My beautiful body Who can bear it. I remember lying on the floor next to a bowl of oatmeal I couldn&rsquo;t remember how to touch my body to / and a woman holding me. I have always called it The Blood Barn / The starving / ecstatic teenage girl / a student about to be 20 / An attempt that was never vain / <em>Would you describe her as vain? Would you still describe her painful body </em>/ <em>as</em> <em>clearly pleading for your help </em>/ <em>Is her presence such </em>/<em> a distraction</em> /I am flinching or free / the girl Flesh of carnation / Who folded in on herself so that her thinking / her pain could be exactly as private as it was public<em> Would you still describe her as a painful body </em>/ <em>that didn&rsquo;t do anything but try</em> /<em> to be desirable?</em> / What if it was an attempt to be a force a secret moving apart / An attempt to say, No, I will not move through the world as desirable / <em>a body of little suns I cut a body into little suns</em> There was thick dark hair on my armsA violent achievement of feeling / I wanted to be alive someplace else / </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
When I began The Blood Barn, I wanted to write someplace else / the poem / You&nbsp; &ldquo;writing poems, an employee&rdquo; don&rsquo;t know how much it shows you / You don&rsquo;t know how much my body shows what it holds <em>Does it require belief?</em> / I want to be able to write about how this saved / my life It is inexpressible / my body&rsquo;s capability I am a citizen of this garden&nbsp; / Surprising Carnations + Fish = Book&nbsp; / = a haunt sort of girl.</p>
<br/>

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>What is anorexia to the girl?</em> When I began / The Blood Barn, I knew I was writing about how emotion / trauma / illness / every sentence has moved or does moves through this body / What it does to acknowledge what happens / to create a word / out of a phrase / out of shitting flowers / for what does go on. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
*<br/>
  But how it felt, / what I came to feel while writing this surprised me / It displaced me. </p>


<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
*</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
Not long after I read The Blood Barn out loud and unfinished, I read Maggie Nelson&rsquo;s <em>The Argonauts</em> and spent time thinking about the presence of her mother. <em>Who is a consequence / What is consequence </em>Not long after I read The Blood Barn out loud and unfinished, the tendons in my wrist swelled and suddenly hurt. <em>Are you still </em>/ <em>where you were living? What kind of space does it take? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
I don&rsquo;t know my body but am fabulously intimate with my body. I don&rsquo;t know my body but I&rsquo;ve come to see, in this writing, that recovery isn&rsquo;t the form I commit and commit to / that isn&rsquo;t going to touch what exists there / what is needed to continue / To move a hurt cardinal out of the road when before / you didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know my body but feel angry when Maggie Nelson describes her mother / a woman who refuses to eat / and it feels like I&rsquo;m supposed to think she&rsquo;s the weak little body / A desperation. I don&rsquo;t disagree I remember / </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
A desperation / buying diet pills + <em>People </em>magazine at CVS with a credit card / running seventy miles a week / A bitch w/ hips so tight they turn down and 2 the left in excess A bitch passing out reading <em>Women in Love</em> / A bitch rubbed raw / scrubbing the puke out of her bedroom carpet at her parents&rsquo; house / after I had to pretend to eat. But is this the center / pity + a thinness / a narrative for the presumed body / that predictably succumbs / ?? / to obliteration / via maleness + heterosexual fever / ?? / to pulling her blood / her secret / her inside as close to an exposed surface as possible / ?? / </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
What saves her / I don&rsquo;t know my body but am fabulously intimate with my body / I know a power / that hates bodies and I could I live in fear of seeing myself / my body but I still want to insist / None of this works for me None of this is / me, a narrative. Not long after I read The Blood Barn out loud and unfinished, I held my wrist and knew I was writing this / I held my wrist and knew I was feeling this / <em>What is a descendant of sensitivity?</em> A swell and a poem about a secret / other kindness dangerously another so I could experience her / a woman as real / I put my body against it and I move apart there / How is a citation, something you&rsquo;ve never read, a thing you are reading / a girl. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
Question: What is poetry? Why do you write it? </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>To trace multiple accounts of the word.</em><em>
  </em>
  <em>To trace how the word impels or impales the body</em> /<em> the flower.</em><em>

  <em>As things spill over.</em><em>
  </em>
  <em>As density is unloaded.</em><em>
  </em>
  <em>As rhythm is unloaded, rhythm strays.</em><em>

<em>The Devil inside me / The Flower inside me</em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>What happened to the lyric? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>


<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>Have you ever felt safe in your body? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
No. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>


<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
*</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
This isn&rsquo;t the story of a girl. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
This is a girl who saw purple, then green, then orange, then sea foam, then navy. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
crumpled Tulip in a dream hole <em>Does it require belief?</em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">

<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
When I began The Blood Barn, I had begun seeing a chiropractor because the pain in my hip, a pain that began during the peak of anorexia, had returned. A scar tissue, a hard dead fog. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
Then, every way I was looked at and examined revealed nothing. Then, a hard dead fog rubbed me and rubbed me and soaked me doctors rubbed me and rubbed me with therapists and butter and shots of cortisol and electrical pulses soaked me until I left the country and did something like not turn away from my body / with feeling. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
I have not seen my body since any of this happened, but I do feel it. A big dead fog or a ghost or my remains looking at me or a girl falling down in the snow. <em>What is a consequence? Who is a consequence? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
*</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
It&rsquo;s been almost a year since I began The Blood Barn and now, the chiropractor, who has the same name as a poet, she holds my wrist / a hard dead fog doctors rubbed with braces and butter / she holds my wrist / the one I melted a red ice cube on / She holds my wrist and says, It&rsquo;s travelled hasn&rsquo;t it. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
I work to not cry every time I speak with her. Not because I&rsquo;m sad / but because I&rsquo;m often overwhelmed at the amount of feeling we are able to exchange when we&rsquo;re close in proximity and attention. I can&rsquo;t often say what those feelings even are / what they are attached to for each of us / I don&rsquo;t know her I can only acknowledge it / <em>Am I even a poet</em>. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
I leave work to go somewhere else / I leave work where my body is told to hold it and hold it and hold it / I leave work as the girl possessed and eating an orange/ I leave work in August / having just turned 30 / the weak little body strong as life strong as violets / having never turned away from trying / to understand how this poem is changing citation / narrative / healing / a physical means for me.</p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>Do you live in a state of repercussion? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
I let a red ice cube melt on my wrist and I decide to go to a myofascial release therapist named Carl Another C / A desperation / but one meant to give language to my body / instead of to this poem / to any poem. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
The man A kind of oval / An odd witness A kind body / Another C / holds my wrist / presses my sternum / presses my ears and moves it apart there / the fascia the entire spread of Her massive tissue / recombines or melts there into the weak little body&rsquo;s flinches / strong as life strong as violets / I come home </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
and lay my hand on my stomach and tell N that I will never write poems / but I will lay my hand on my stomach and for the first time / feel something there like presence / like touching / my body as it is / I come home and lay my hand on my stomach and tell N the question I need / a question put tenderly and suddenly towards / by Another C </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
<em>Have you ever felt safe in your body? </em></p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">
The girl faces freedom and it is excruciating. I&rsquo;m terrified this / the way I construct something / the activity in my body a form / is unlistenable / unreadable / I can only write here / I can only never write poems / that are poems my body here / strong as life strong as violets To move a hurt cardinal out of the road when before / you didn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p style="font-size:10.6pt;">&nbsp;</p>
