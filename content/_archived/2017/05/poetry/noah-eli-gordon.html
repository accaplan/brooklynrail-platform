All the geraniums&nbsp; 
  All the paintings of geraniums&nbsp; 
  All the photographs of geraniums&nbsp; 
  The word <em>geranium</em> 
  In all the languages 
  That have a word for geraniums&nbsp; 
  Lucky you &amp; your constant removal 
  My daughter who doesn't know 
  Why she&rsquo;s crying tells me 
  I feel like there are&nbsp; 
  Tornadoes in my head 
  She&rsquo;s four and her drawings 
  Of flowers look like the sun </p>

Her parachute is cumbersome&nbsp; 
  And difficult to return to its pack 
  She points from her yard 
  And you follow her finger&nbsp; 
  Clouds hang like deflated ghosts&nbsp; 
  Daily you both consume protocol 
  The steps so familiar&nbsp; 
  The grass grows remote 
  The sky doesn&rsquo;t matter 
  My daughter says 
  A ghost is just a lump 
  And some lines&nbsp; 
  All this talk of airplanes&nbsp; 
  All this fear of heights&nbsp; </p>

<p style="font-size: 13pt;">Conundrum&nbsp;</p><br/>
<p>
The day&rsquo;s begun to resemble 
  An undeniably average day 
  And in order to harness the luxury&nbsp; 
  Required to make such a report 
  I&rsquo;ve dropped off at daycare my daughter 
  Who perhaps even now 
  Is making some cognitive association&nbsp; 
  That without my help&nbsp;will alight&nbsp; 
  Anew a question darting&nbsp; 
  In the half-formed darkness 
  Of her brain like a few drunken bats&nbsp; 
  Moving with alien deliberateness&nbsp; 
  If you could figure out the pattern 
  You&rsquo;d be able to pluck them 
  Easily from the air&nbsp; 
  But human intelligence&nbsp; 
  Resists successfully such a&nbsp; 
  Conundrum and so we go on 
  If we&rsquo;re lucky enough 
  With our awe at the world around us 
  It&rsquo;s necessary work&nbsp; 
  Sometimes a morning&rsquo;s worth&nbsp; 
  Sometimes a week 
  Picasso said it took him a lifetime&nbsp; 
  To learn how to draw with the eye 
  Of a child 
  I&rsquo;ve got an hour before 
  I have to pick mine up </p>

<p>
I like the quotable parts </p>

They&rsquo;re like seeds that live forever </p>

You don&rsquo;t even need&nbsp; 
  To put them in the dirt </p>

I want you 
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To go away&nbsp; 
  So I have time 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To write&nbsp;

There&rsquo;s no one 
  There&rsquo;s no one in 
  There&rsquo;s no one in the dark 
  There&rsquo;s no one 
  In the darkened 
  Frozen food aisle 
  Whose lights come on 
  Only when you&rsquo;re close enough 
  To actually touch 
  What you might buy for dessert </p>
