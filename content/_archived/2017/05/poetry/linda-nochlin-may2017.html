The Sex-Life of the Mollusk, or
  Pornography is Where You Make It</p><br/>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;">
&ldquo;The beginnings of copulation in the mollusks, for example,
give way to very strange gropings before the act is adapted.&rdquo; 
<span style="margin-left:230px;">&#150; Jean Piaget, footnote</span></p>
<br/>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">
Beneath the surface of the sea
  Lurk shoals of shelled perversity;
  Who would believe that bivalves share
  In sins to which the flesh is heir?
  Or that the inoffensive squid
  Indulges his calcareous id?</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">
The mollusk lusts in bed of slime,
  Where, sheltered by unblushing brine,
  His moist, tentacular embrace
  Hovering on satisfaction, waits
  Til strangely groped by mollusk mate,
  His partner oozes to her fate.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">
Oh, who would dream of deviation
  In such restricted circumstance?
  Does pause before mere penetration
  Refresh subaqueous romance?
  Oyster orgies, clams in drag
  Fellation for consenting crabs;
  How must the modest mussel feel
  When buggered by an invert eel?</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">
Imagination boggles at
  The mollusk as a pornocrat.
  (Or is this needless agitation
  Brought on by simple mistranslation?)
  In any case, we cannot claim
  That man alone makes sex a game.
  No limits to lubricity
  Are set to sex beneath the sea;
  Nor, if you really think it through,
  Are mollusks better off than you.</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em;">
All pleasures that are good per se
  Are better yet some kinkier way:
  Oysters Rockefeller, moules in wine,
  Clams in chowder &#150; all divine!
  Although, if one likes seafood well
  One won&rsquo;t disdain it on the shell.</p>

Carpaccio&rsquo;s <em>Birth of the Virgin</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;margin-left:200px;">For H.M.</p><br/>
<p>
Two rabbits, nibbling lettuce on the floor,
  Have stopped the rush of masculine perspective.
  Lying in bed beneath her canopy
  Anna is calmly self-absorbed, reflective.
  She alone is thought, all around
  Her world of women welcomes the new girl
  With tasks of homely job, and tasks abound.
  One turns a spindle in a distant room
  Another warms the diaper at her fire
  A turbaned matron occupies herself
  With swaddling tape; all hands conspire
  In the timeless ceremonial of the womb.
  The old nurse shifts her weight to feel the bath
  The baby Virgin sheltered in her arm;
  Only old impotent Joseph on his stick
  Is left to represent the masculine rance.
  He&rsquo;s clearly on the way. Cleanliness, charm
  And order mark this space
  As holy, with the unself-conscious grace
  Of ordinary caring. On the wall,
  Above the shelf with candle, bowls and fruit
  A Hebrew tablet, sign of the arcane,
  Warns of future glory, future doom.
  Meanwhile, a modest servant robed in red
  Cools down the mother&rsquo;s porridge with her spoon.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13pt;">
This is my mother&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<br/>
<p>
She is gone now, she left with little pain
  Barely a groan, nothing romantic, her last words
  When asked &ldquo;how do you feel?&rdquo;
  Were &ldquo;I feel rotten.&rdquo; Does this mean
  Anything at all? I doubt it but last words
  Take on an aura of their own, as though
  They hid some higher, deeper truth about the
  Dear departed. Someone unexpected, like Wittgenstein
  But not quite let out &ldquo;Mozartele!&rdquo; at the last minute.
  Dick&rsquo;s last quotables were &ldquo;I want to enjoy my life&rdquo;
  Well this means something, certainly, but nothing
  Mysterious there, quite straightforward. Or perhaps
  A terrible last minute regret for not having done so.
  It is hard to be sentimental about someone so determined
  Not to be, herself. She pulled her life to the vanishing point
  In the end. What was she afraid of? Of life itself
  It seems. And yet, she, more than anyone else enjoyed
  Things for their own sake. Ballet, the dance, the beautiful
  Legs of the boys; beautiful boys in general, objectively, at
  Eighty-two &ldquo;What a beautiful young man!&rdquo; she&rsquo;d cry. Whye
  Did she pare her life down to the fleshless bones of being?
  Yet she read all through her life, until the end, it dwindled with
  Her eyes. Smaller and smaller the circumference of her days
  Less and less the vital pleasure of the ear, the mind of the eye.
  Her wit, however, never deserted her. At times it was outre,
  Embarrassing but undiscouraged it endured. No real suffering
  Just the final trip in the ambulance, the meaningless
  End of it all.
  From the beginning
  She was the mainstay of my life
  My maker. She made me feel and think.
  She&rsquo;d been to Paris in her early days
  And met my father there and married him.
  A great mistake (not Paris, but my father).
  She had a room in some white Russians&rsquo; house
  In the Sixieme, near Gertrude Stein. On rue Madame I think,
  A very early-thirties place to stay.
  Together
  We made music, danced and sang.
  She read me Joyce when I was eight, the start
  Of Portrait of the Artist, animal noises.
  And Katherine Mansfield, Catherine Anne Porter,
  Odd, mannered birds, popular at the time like Elinor Wylie whose
  Venetian Glass Nephew I illustrated
  With drawings precious as her literary style
  And Thomas Mann, especially disorder and early sorrow
  Which meant a lot to her: that inward way of getting at
  The viewpoint of the child. She saw the subtlety of Mann,
  His deft embrace
  Of childhood angst, like little Hanno Buddenbrooks
  Incapable&nbsp; of &ldquo;making the mill&rdquo; at dancing school with
  All the blue-eyed children. Did she identify with outcasts? I do not think so
  It was the miracle of the Great Man who could
  Empathize with someone so young, a tragedy so small
  That moved her. So I sought for similar movements of the heart
  And drew a wistful Tonio Kroger lying on a chaise lounge
  With ruffles at his wrists. Later, we went to plays: for
  My twelfth birthday, The Three Sisters with Eva Legalienne,
  Junior Miss and Streetcar Named Desire; the Dark at the Top
  Of the Stairs. She had gone to the Theater Guild in her youth,
  A passion of my grandfather&rsquo;s, and seen all the great O&rsquo;Neils
  In first production. Those were the days. What happened to that
  Heady excitement of the mind, the senses? She passed it on to me,
  The mad art-lover, concertgoer, dance aficionado, poetry reader
  And left nothing for herself. Not out of self-sacrifice, that wasn&rsquo;t at
  All her style, but out of a kind piecemeal enervation, to borrow
  Not quite correctly from Ezra Pound. She simply couldn&rsquo;t be bothered
  Later on to see the art, to read the books, to watch the dance as
  Once she had. She was just (pace Emily D.) locking up to die
  &ldquo;Mortality&rsquo;s old custom.....&rdquo;</p>

Visitation</p>
<br/>
<p>
Outside the walls, before the iron gates
  We met, two massive women, tenderly embracing
  Our bulging bellies bumping through
  The heavy, hanging folds. Inside, deep in the
  Cave of waters, the little heads collided gently,
  Girl and boy. Both redheads it turned out, children of the spring,
  Both chosen, marked with wary grace.</p>
<p>
What mysteries of propinquity and absence
  Grow from a legend, lend themselves to
  Imperceptible change, marvelous latency?
  All meetings are miracles. Shells mingle with other shells,
  The surface changes with the tides, vast plates slide and clash
  Towers fall, fields become garbage dumps, lakes
  Breed slime and monsters. We hold hands above the city
  And drink martinis, talk of love and work, watch over this tenuous island,
  This Manhattan. Soon it will be over.</p>
<p>
When I am laid to rest in the dark cave of earth or
  Rise beyond time on wings of fire
  Your hand will be in mine,
  Growing like a vine beyond the stars, the moon
  The sun, to realms we can only dream of
  Here on earth Only love me, touch my hand. It will happen soon.</p>
