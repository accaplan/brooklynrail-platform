<p style="font-size: 13pt;">Hey Kids</p>
<p>
The craziness that drove me to her
  What madness you perceived in me fleeing
  Such tumult creating/destroying
  Without which nothing is nor was,
  Its better stuff combusting in passion
  Engendering both you and our anguish.</p>
<p>
Nothing is true except...no, nothing is
  Sedation sought and utilized isn&rsquo;t much
  Void discovered while simply being isn&rsquo;t
  Fried clam strips sizzling aren&rsquo;t nor
  Bass envelope containing Arthur Killer Kane&rsquo;s
  Mormon missive from Morrissey&rsquo;s London.</p>
<p>
So, bad girl, what you trying to do
  Playing with those pre-punk dolls
  In New York where Arthur and I
  Grew on 257th Street in terracotta flower pots
  On that window sill between Hillside and Union Turnpike
  Hardly the family homestead or ranch</p>
<p>
Complete with flowering veranda
  Hey kids, there&rsquo;s no returning
  Check out what we all share
  Not so bad considering all that was
  Although she continues to wither,
  So much beautiful intelligence lost.</p>
<p>
Yet ever more brilliant remaining
  Beauty going going on forever in
  You and yours who manifest
  Whatever it was engendered
  All of us when the Sixties&rsquo; ghost still 
  Embodied something quite incredible.</p>
