title: 'From Watermelon to Lemonade Sobering Up with Beyonc&#233;'
---

<p>&ldquo;Drunk in Love&rdquo; dropped along with thirteen other tracks at midnight on December 13, 2013, and promptly got stuck in all of our heads. Its freedom and ecstasy were infectious. I remember it going through my head nights after <em>I been drinking</em>, accompanying my tipsy train of thought. Its sexiness and freedom were infectious. But sexiness and freedom were easier then. This was during the Obama years.</p>

<p>The video begins with surf at night. The camera comes into focus on a woman on the beach. She&rsquo;s carrying a trophy. She&rsquo;s weaving as she walks. This is a woman who&rsquo;s been celebrating. The instrumental is horror-movie-like at first&#8212;high-pitched violins, sudden movements. After a weird helium-high wail, Beyonc&#233;&rsquo;s voice comes in, a husky alto. <em>I been drinking.</em></p>

<p>Part of what&rsquo;s so compelling about the video&#8212;and the song&#8212;is that the initial creepiness seems to be a fake-out. Once things get going, it&rsquo;s clear Bey&rsquo;s having a great time. The joy in her relaxed smile, in the swing of her arms, her bouncing dance&#8212;unbridled seduction! A drunk woman is vulnerable, a woman alone is vulnerable&#8212;but here is a drunk woman alone with a trophy and reveling. </p>

<p>The orchestration weaves in and out, illustrating drunkenness musically, while Bey performs drunkenness with funny, innuendo-rich lyrics. Like a real drunk, she is less sensible than sensual. She argues she&rsquo;s fine, only to trail off sloppily and confused: &ldquo;Never tired, never tired. I been sipping; that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s keeping me on fire, me on fire. Didn&rsquo;t mean to spill that liquor all on my attire. I&rsquo;ve been drinking [pause] watermelon.&rdquo; Her recurring conclusion is always the same: &ldquo;Drunk in love!&rdquo; Her jumbled thoughts come to rest on &ldquo;na na,&rdquo; that universal nonsense lyric for THIS IS SO FUN! From the Beach Boys&rsquo; &ldquo;Good Vibrations&rdquo; to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),&rdquo; to M.I.A.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boyz,&rdquo; &ldquo;na na&rdquo; is a performance of enjoyment, nostalgic yet aggressive&#8212;but Beyonc&#233;&rsquo;s &ldquo;na na&rdquo; descends in a minor third, sighing with shaky vibrato and exhausted acquiescence. </p>

<p>Listening to &ldquo;Drunk in Love&rdquo; today, I hear that exhaustion more clearly. It has been three years. Our nation is older. Our first black president&#8212;an eloquent, measured product of academia and community activism&#8212;has been succeeded by our first orange president&#8212;an incoherent, impulsive product of entertainment. Our basically progressive, judicious political rhetoric&#8212;what many of us believed was in some way the <em>truth</em>&#8212;has been replaced by paranoid racist-misogynist-xenophobic &ldquo;alternative facts,&rdquo; &ldquo;fake news,&rdquo; &ldquo;truthiness,&rdquo; and illusion. Our cultural conversation about black bodies and the atrocities routinely committed against them has (at last) become mainstream. But the glory of a beautiful black woman dancing drunk and free and safe feels like a prisoner&rsquo;s dream today. We have sobered up, exchanged our &ldquo;watermelon&rdquo; for <em>Lemonade</em>.</p>

<p>Today I can hear what I was deaf to then: the horror movie is not a fake-out. The &ldquo;last thing&rdquo;<em> </em>she<em> </em>remembers,<em> </em>after all,<em> </em>is<em> their </em>&ldquo;beautiful bodies grinding up in that club.&rdquo; And then? <em>They</em> &ldquo;woke up in the kitchen saying how the hell did this shit happen<em>.</em>&rdquo;<em> </em>What happened while she was blacked out? The husband tells us:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol </p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">Slip the panties right to the side</p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">Ain&rsquo;t got the time to take drawers off, on site</p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">Catch a charge I might. Beat the box up, like Mike </p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">In &rsquo;97, I bite, I&rsquo;m Ike, Turner, turn up</p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">Baby, no I don&rsquo;t play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae</p>

<p class="blockquote-poetry">Said, &ldquo;Eat the cake, Anna Mae!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the space of a few lines, Jay Z references not one but two out of control, abusive men. The &rsquo;97 bite is Mike Tyson. &ldquo;Eat the cake, Anna Mae&rdquo; comes from Tina Turner&rsquo;s 1986 autobiography (and/or its &rsquo;93 movie adaptation, <em>What&rsquo;s Love Got to Do with It</em>). The Turners are at a diner celebrating with friends when two kids come over to get Tina&rsquo;s autograph. Jealous and hostile, Ike encourages her to eat some cake. When she won&rsquo;t, he becomes enraged, assaulting a friend who defends her, smashing the cake in her face.</p>

<p>A few journalists noted this reference when the song came out, but it wasn&rsquo;t made much of. Daniel D&rsquo;Addario noted in <em>Salon </em>that it was &ldquo;a particularly surprising lyric since Jay Z&rsquo;s support of Beyonc&#233;&rsquo;s career success&#8212;which, much like Tina Turner&rsquo;s, has surpassed her husband&rsquo;s&#8212;is unconditional and seemingly freely given.&rdquo; Today, that &ldquo;seemingly&rdquo; haunts. Jay Z&rsquo;s reference, even if delivered playfully, feels like a threatening omen. Its message is not just that a celebrity marriage can be accompanied by violence. It&rsquo;s that there are consequences to being a powerful woman. That the rage of men is real.</p>

<p>Watch Beyonc&#233; when Jay Z raps. She screws up her face, mugging for the camera, a feminine parody of masculinity. She is confrontational, challenging. She is enjoying herself. Could it be that she&rsquo;s mocking him? That she&rsquo;s mocking us? Let&rsquo;s remember that <em>Lemonade </em>came out just two and a half years later<em>. </em>The initial speculation it ignited about Jay Z&rsquo;s infidelity and the couple&rsquo;s rumored impending divorce gave way rapidly to fascination with its sophisticated references and celebration of its feminist messages. In light of <em>Lemonade, </em>I find a new, if cynical satisfaction in &ldquo;Drunk in Love&rdquo; today, beyond its catchy tune and cathartic structure: in that disturbing yet thrilling confusion between truth and illusion. </p>
