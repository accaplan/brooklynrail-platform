<div style="margin-left:70px;">
<p style="font-size: 13pt;"> 2. The Disquieting Muses</p>

<p>
Boredom sets in first, and then despair.
One tries to brush it off. It only grows.
Something about the silence of the square.</p>

<p>
Something is wrong; something about the air,
Its color; about the light, the way it glows.
Boredom sets in first, and then despair.</p>

<p>
The muses in their fluted evening wear,
Their faces blank, might lead one to suppose
Something about the silence of the square,</p>

<p>
Something about the buildings standing there.
But no, they have no purpose but to pose.
Boredom sets in first, and then despair.</p>

<p>
What happens after than, one doesn&rsquo;t care.
What brought one here&#8212;the desire to compose
Something about the silence of the square,</p>

<p>
Or something else, of which one&rsquo;s not aware,
Life itself, perhaps&#8212;who really knows?
Boredom sets in first, and then despair&#8230;
Something about the silence of the square.</p>
