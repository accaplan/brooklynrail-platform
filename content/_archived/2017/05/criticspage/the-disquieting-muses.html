Mother, mother, what illbred aunt 
Or what disfigured and unsightly 
Cousin did you so unwisely keep 
Unasked to my christening, that she 
Sent these ladies in her stead 
With heads like darning-eggs to nod 
And nod and nod at foot and head 
And at the left side of my crib? </p>
<p>
Mother, who made to order stories 
Of Mixie Blackshort the heroic bear, 
Mother, whose witches always, always, 
Got baked into gingerbread, I wonder 
Whether you saw them, whether you said 
Words to rid me of those three ladies 
Nodding by night around my bed, 
Mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head. </p>
<p>
In the hurricane, when father&rsquo;s twelve 
Study windows bellied in 
Like bubbles about to break, you fed 
My brother and me cookies and Ovaltine 
And helped the two of us to choir: 
&ldquo;Thor is angry: boom boom boom! 
Thor is angry: we don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; 
But those ladies broke the panes. </p>
<p>
When on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced, 
Blinking flashlights like fireflies 
And singing the glowworm song, I could 
Not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress 
But, heavy-footed, stood aside 
In the shadow cast by my dismal-headed 
Godmothers, and you cried and cried: 
And the shadow stretched, the lights went out.</p>
<p>
Mother, you sent me to piano lessons 
And praised my arabesques and trills 
Although each teacher found my touch 
Oddly wooden in spite of scales 
 And the hours of practicing, my ear 
Tone-deaf and yes, unteachable. 
I learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere, 
From muses unhired by you, dear mother,</p>
<p>
I woke one day to see you, mother, 
Floating above me in bluest air 
On a green balloon bright with a million 
Flowers and bluebirds that never were 
Never, never, found anywhere. 
But the little planet bobbed away 
Like a soap-bubble as you called: Come here! 
And I faced my traveling companions. </p>
<p>
Day now, night now, at head, side, feet, 
They stand their vigil in gowns of stone, 
Faces blank as the day I was born, 
Their shadows long in the setting sun 
That never brightens or goes down. 
And this is the kingdom you bore me to, 
Mother, mother. But no frown of mine 
Will betray the company I keep.</p>
