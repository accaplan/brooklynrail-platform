<p>Months of political unrest and now the question of art&#8212;its role, responsibilities, and possibilities&#8212;weighs on New York. Addressing both currents, the Met Breuer houses <em>Lygia Pape: A Multitude of Forms,</em> the first major retrospective of the artist in the United States. Honoring the five-decade career of the pivotal Brazilian artist, this timely survey brings forth an alternative tale of the evolution of Modern art, one that functions independently from New York, and presents a moving practice that is both determined by and bluntly audible under political oppression. </p>

<p>Recognized as prominently for abstract geometry as for performance art, Lygia Pape&rsquo;s practice&#8212;expanding across painting, print-making, video, performance, installation, architecture, poetry, and teaching&#8212;bloomed in Brazil&rsquo;s hopeful postwar years and leftist 1950s government, and was later shaped by the horrific dictatorship brought by the 1964 military coup. Curated around what has defined and bound Pape&rsquo;s multifaceted practice together, this retrospective underlines her unwavering social engagement through&#8212;and not in opposition to&#8212;a passion for form. </p>

<p>Consuming the entirety of Breuer&rsquo;s fourth floor, <em>A Multitude of Forms</em> has a predominantly chronological approach, with each of its constructed galleries dedicated to an era of the artist&rsquo;s work. The narrative begins with postwar Brazil and Pape&rsquo;s early work as a member of Grupo Frente&#8212;a movement enchanted by Europe&rsquo;s Concretism&#8212;and the start of a career-long devotion to the language of abstract geometric art. But to understand the movement and Pape&rsquo;s formal language requires moving beyond the dominant narratives of art history, centered around Europe and the United States. For Grupo Frente, the exploration of abstraction is a protest against the muralist movements saturated by propaganda; geometry is homage to similar Soviet movements; rationality is a celebration in accordance with local achievements of modernity (the capital Bras&#237;lia, founded in 1960, is a masterwork of modern architecture and urban planning). The exhibition eloquently offers the context needed. </p>!!img2!!


<p>Entering the Cold-War era, history unfolded to challenge modern civil society&rsquo;s hopes for the future. Dismantled by disagreements around the limits of rationalism, Grupo Frente ended, and Neo-Concretism was formed. With artists such as Lygia Clark, H&#233;lio Oiticica, and Pape, this new movement emphasized experimental approaches: &ldquo;the expressive possibilities opened by these experiences&rdquo;&#8212;as put by Ferrieira Gullar, poet and the author of their manifesto. The show unravels this transitory time in Pape&rsquo;s work, from her early compositional <em>Reliefs</em> (1953 &#8211; 54), to her optical <em>Weavings</em> (1955 &#8211; 60), to her Neo-Concrete heights, when she explored language, form, space, and time&#8212;breaking barriers between print-making, sculpture, video, book-making, poetry, and even opera. Her <em>Book of Creation</em> (1959 &#8211; 60) is a profound example of this. Sixteen replicated pages are freely displayed for museumgoers to investigate and interact. On each, Pape combines a simple sentence with one of her non-objects. One reads, &ldquo;Man began to measure time&rdquo;&#8212;a white square with a circular red disk in its center. Rotating around a center-point, the circle can be completed or entirely hidden; it is upon the viewer to activate it in time and space. Truly, Pape and her peers exceeded their time; long before Minimalists, they used forms to interrupt space and time, and before the conceptualists, they shifted authorship to the audience.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that the Coup interrupted her work. In the late &rsquo;60s, in the height of oppression and the resultant oppositional protests in Brazil, Pape abandoned the confines of prescribed artist spaces to enter her society. In her short film <em>The Egg </em>(1967), the artist emerges out of a white cube placed on a beach. The work is part of a series of performances where the artist and her peers exited abstract forms into the public sphere. Central to the gallery is Pape&rsquo;s iconic <em>Dividor</em> (1968) in which dozens of people bound together by a large white sheet march on the street. They at once become a unified social body, while the sheet separating their heads from the bodies&#8212;hidden beneath&#8212;evokes the surveillance of the autocratic regime. The performance&#8212;brought to New York this March&#8212;remains shockingly poignant today.</p>

<p>With the majority of the remaining gallery space devoted to earlier interactive and large scale work, the exhibition loses its depth in discussing Pape&rsquo;s later practice, the works from which are cramped in side rooms and hard to grasp. In the 1970s&#8212;when she was briefly imprisoned and tortured&#8212;Pape dedicated herself to art education, architecture and its politics, and in the following decades&#8212;from her &ldquo;Amazoninos&rdquo; series (1989 &#8211; 92) to her &ldquo;Tupinamb&#225;&rdquo; series (1997 &#8211; 2007)&#8212;she dug into the country&rsquo;s haunting colonial history. </p>

<p>The exhibition&rsquo;s final central work is the spectacular installation <em>Tt&#233;ia 1, C </em>(1976 &#8211; 2004/2017), a large black room in which monumental columns of golden thread interrupt the utter darkness. The luminous lines simultaneously mimic beams of sunlight and recall prison-cell bars, entirely moving. Closely in conversation with her early <em>Weavings</em>, the piece unravels Pape&rsquo;s at her best: a tireless poet fluent in the language of form and determined to address our politically disturbed world.  </p>
