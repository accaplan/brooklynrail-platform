title: EVERYONE GETS LIGHTER

<p><blockquote>Life is lots of presents,
and every single day you get 
a big bunch of gifts
under a sparkling pine tree 
hung with countless balls of colored lights;
piles of presents wrapped in fancy paper,
the red box with the green ribbon,
and the green box with the red ribbon,
and the blue one with silver, 
and the white one with gold.

It&#146;s not 
what happens,
it&#146;s how you
handle it.

You are in a water bubble human body,
on a private jet
in seemingly a god world,
a glass of champagne,
and a certain luminosity
and emptiness,
skin of air,
a flat sea of white clouds below
and vast dome of blue sky above,
and your mind is an iron nail in-between.

It&#146;s not 
what happens,
it&#146;s how you
handle it.

Dead cat bounce,
catch 
the falling knife,
after endless shadow boxing
in your sleep, 
fighting in your dreams
and knocking yourself out,
you realize everything is empty,
and appears as miraculous display,
all are in nature
the play of emptiness and clarity.

Everyone 
gets
lighter
everyone
gets lighter
everyone gets
lighter
everyone gets lighter,
everyone is light.</blockquote></p>
