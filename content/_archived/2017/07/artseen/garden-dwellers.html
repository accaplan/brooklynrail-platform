<p><em>Garden Dwellers</em>, a vibrant group show of 23 works by 13 artists on view at Regina Rex on the Lower East Side, assembles a biodiversity of artworks full of rebellious color and fertile thinking. Described as &ldquo;an Eden in the city,&rdquo; the exhibition has little time for the shame of a disobedient Eve&#151;nor the perpetuation of the Cartesian split between mind and body used by Western thought to subjugate women, colonized peoples, and nature. Instead, it leaps unabashedly into a radical <em>jouissance</em>, the French term for orgasm or bliss that H&eacute;l&egrave;ne&nbsp;Cixous, by way of Jacques Lacan uses as a rallying cry for abundant, effervescent, female creativity. These garden dwellers bask in earthly delights, as in Amy Lincoln&rsquo;s luminous Afro-Caribbean-inflected depictions of florid jungles in radioactive technicolor <em>Lily and Ranunculus</em> (2017), which challenge the staid colonial gaze of a Henri Rousseau-like imagination. Here the lilies themselves touch, penetrate, and transform us with their own agency. </p>!!img2!!
<p>The namesake of <em>Garden Dwellers </em>is an oil painting in taupe, black, and green by EJ Hauser, <em>garden dwellers (spring</em>) (2015) which can be read as an abstract picture of potted plants and a wrought-iron gate, or as a map of a secret garden. Like all of the works in this show, its perspective dissolves the boundaries between self and the other, body and mind, inside and outside, evoking the pre-Oedipal pleasure in the body before the separation of knowledge from desire. </p>!!img3!!
<p>Other works depict raucous unwieldy bodies such as Heidi Norton&rsquo;s large glass sculpture <em>Spirals </em>(2015), a representation of the body&rsquo;s system of interior spaces, tubes and openings where a sprig of bamboo stands in where the head might be. Similarly, Dave Hardy&rsquo;s foam, cement, and mixed media works are stuffed into rectangles that hang on the wall like soft white bellies seated on the beach in the first days of summer. Maureen St. Vincent&rsquo;s drawings of knots of limbs, tulips, breasts and vulvas offer recognizable bits of the figure woven into undulating abstract forms. With related humor but a different pictorial language, Portia Munson&rsquo;s <em>Potpourri </em>(2000) is a tightly rendered still life of matching pink dildo, wax lips, swollen thumb, and disembodied vulva. </p>!!img4!!
<p>But if one were to imagine how this world of <em>jouissance </em>could be physically accessed, it would be through one of Fabienne Lasserre&rsquo;s many hanging membranes. These sculptures are made from transparent vinyl stretched over an organically ovular frame suggesting windows, sprayed with a gradient of color that fades from opaque to clear. Each is large enough to envelop one&rsquo;s entire body, providing a color-tinted lens through which to view the gallery.</p>
<p>Offering a critique of power, race and gender, Abbey Williams&rsquo; video <em>La Mulatta </em>(2007) overlays transparent footage of the artist as she mimics the posture of a 19th century slave bust by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. This haunting gesture gives life to the sculpture: her edges are blurred by the overlay, her eyes blink. The artist mimics Carpeaux&rsquo;s baroque pose, acknowledging the ongoing impact of a history of subjugated bodies while also occupying and altering the images that male European artists have used to control women of color. Similarly, Bryce Zackery&rsquo;s <em>Coal Miner</em> (2017), a relief sculpture of rope and paint presents a naked fauvist figure who bathes from a bucket of water in front of the coal pit, as if to release himself into a zone of ecstasy after a day of sooty work fueling the industrial economy.</p>
<p>In this sense, the <em>jouissance </em>of<em> Garden Dwellers</em> invites us into ongoing dialogues about gender, race, nature and the body where, instead of mourning paradise lost, we revel in the fact that we already dwell here.</p>
