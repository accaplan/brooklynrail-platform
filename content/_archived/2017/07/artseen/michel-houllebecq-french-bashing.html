<p>Michel Houellebecq is a wielder of blunt instruments. In the best of his novels the cartoon crudity of his choosen conceit&#151;an Islamist takeover of France (<em>Submission, </em>2015), two brothers as matter and anti-matter mattering and not mattering to each other (<em>The Elementary Particles,</em>1998), or clones writing about clones writing about clones (<em>The Possibility of an Island, </em>2005)&#151;serves as a necessary sugarcoat for the bitter pill of abject pessimism that underpins his work. And while he is often over-reliant on the sad sociology of prurient interest, the otherwise consistent virtuosity of his performance raises his parables of contemporary inhumanity&#151;critically, traumatically&#151;into the pantheon of great literature. </p>
<p>A related strategy would seem to be at work in Houellebecq&rsquo;s photographic installation, <em>French Bashing</em>, which was on view at Venus: Manhattan this summer. Taken as a work of spatial theater, <em>French Bashing</em> is brutishly unsubtle. </p>
<p>Entering the gallery, we encounter equal sized photographs, muted gray, lining black walls with low light. From on high, as if man has become a drone, we are presented with the callousness of global capitalism by an eye that seems to believe that strident indexicality or self-indulgent mournfulness are its only options. And yet, Houllebecq choses neither. Blithely artful and cheaply processed, the theatrical impression is that of a permanent historical display in an under-funded regional museum. </p>

<p>We pass through to the second room, this one white with the fluorescent lights turned all the way up. The floor is covered in saturated color-laminated tourist placemats. The photographs retain their listlessness without arriving at existential <em>ennui</em>, even as they tend more fully toward montage. The mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of this room is less specifically mimetic, though perhaps we&rsquo;re in the store-room of an economically depressed travel agency.</p>
<p>Were the formal analogy to Houellebecq&rsquo;s novelistic strategy to hold true, we would expect this ham-handed theatricality to belie a laser light photographic talent: just the right framing of just the right subject at just the right moment to declare for us <em>Yes! Global capitalism is a big fucking drag and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to be hopeful about, but damn if he didn&rsquo;t capture this pessimistic sentiment perfectly!</em> Or perhaps some wink in the press might point us toward a crack in the fourth wall, with Houellebecq&rsquo;s Triboulet&nbsp;grin peaking out from the other side&#151;more fuel for the public fire of his authorial celebrity. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case. Houellebecq takes a decent picture, not a great one&#151;certainly nothing that has earned more than a thumb-scroll of engagement. And nothing in the processing and printing hints at the mastery that might make the <em>on-the-nose-ness</em> of this mundanity a feat of fiction rather than just the facts. There is an aloofness to his image making that recalls Godard&rsquo;s <em>Goodbye to Language</em>, sans the filmmaker&rsquo;s stunning revelation that he can make a great film out of anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And while Houellebecq&rsquo;s public caricature has strengthened the capacity of his work to serve as a metaphor for aspects of our own moment, both intentionally (as in <em>The Map and the Territory</em>) and through devastating serendipity (as with <em>Submission</em>), neither his own talent nor horrific world events have aligned to add any vicious charm or supranatural heft to <em>French Bashing</em>. </p>
<p>C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>
