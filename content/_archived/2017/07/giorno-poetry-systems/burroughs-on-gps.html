title: BURROUGHS ON GPS
---

<p>I was twenty-six when I purchased the book that introduced me to William Burroughs&rsquo;s cut-up tape experiments. I rarely bought new books in my twenties. Mostly, I would pick up inexpensive second-hand copies of poetry books and visit St. Mark&rsquo;s Bookshop to browse but, in 1997, I left with a copy of <em>Wireless Imagination: Sound, Radio, and the Avant-Garde</em> (1992) edited by Douglas Kahn and Gregory Whitehead. I carried the book around for a period of time and read certain chapters more closely than others. The one I read in its entirety was &ldquo;Sound Identity Fading Out: William Burroughs&rsquo; Tape Experiments,&rdquo; by Robin Lyndenberg.</p>!!img1!!<p>Flash forward to 1999; I find myself enrolled in a graduate course taught by John Szwed, a professor of Anthropology and African American Studies in the division of Sociocultural Anthropology. I don&rsquo;t remember much about the class except that one of the editors of <em>Wireless Imagination</em> was mentioned in the course readings, which prompted me to enroll. Something else happened in 1999: Douglas Kahn published his book <em>Noise, Water, Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts</em>, dedicating another chapter to Burroughs&rsquo;s sound work.</p>!!img2!!
<p>Between my purchases of Kahn&rsquo;s two books, Giorno Poetry Systems released the four-disc box set <em>The Best of William Burroughs </em>(1998). The collection made it possible for me to hear the tape experiments I had been reading about and to write about them for Szwed&rsquo;s class. Giorno describes the collection as a &ldquo;voice portrait&rdquo;&mdash;recordings of readings and performances compiled over thirty-five years. Burroughs was thirty-eight years old in 1959 when the project began, and eighty-one years old in 1995 when the last recording was made, just two years prior to his death. That&rsquo;s a pretty rich voice history. &ldquo;Wisdom is his voice&rdquo; is the name of Giorno&rsquo;s text in the booklet accompanying the box set and, revisiting this material now, I am struck by the generosity of the project. It cast Giorno in a system that is multi-part: part author, part archivist, part producer, part impresario, part witness, part muse, part cohort, part lover, part friend, and so on.</p>
<p>This brings me to John Giorno the poet. I used to love seeing him read in the &lsquo;90s at the annual New Year&rsquo;s Day Marathon reading that the Poetry Project hosted at St. Mark&rsquo;s Church. One year, Giorno read a poem&mdash;arms and body flailing about the stage&mdash;while telling of a young man who kissed him in a subway station bathroom. It was an anonymous hookup; one of many, but what made the encounter different was the kisser&rsquo;s passion. The young man was going at it with John as if he was in love with him, as if it was something other than what it was&mdash;but how could it be? The man was a stranger to Giorno, the poem alleges. It also outs the identity of the kisser: Keith Haring before he was Keith Haring. I will venture to guess that Haring did love John Giorno, loved him for as long as that kiss lasted.</p>
