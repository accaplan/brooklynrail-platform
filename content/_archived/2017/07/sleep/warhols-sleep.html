title: WARHOL'S SLEEP
---

<p>As a child, I often visited friends of my parents, who had a candle in the shape of the Empire State Building in their living room cabinet. For many years, I avoided taking a closer look, believing it to be indecent. Only later, as a teenager, and knowing something about the building, did I realize what that ominous&mdash;and already long-gone&mdash;object actually represented. The associative form of the building&mdash;the Empire State, or the center and peak of the world&rsquo;s capital, New York City&mdash;is clear even to a child. The building&rsquo;s prominence motivated&nbsp;Warhol&nbsp;to take its portrait like a star, like a person. For eight hours he focused the camera on the skyscraper for Empire (1964), depicting it in a changing range of light situations. According to&nbsp;Warhol, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an eight hour hard on. It&rsquo;s so beautiful. The lights come on and stars come out and it sways.&rdquo;</p>!!img1!!	
<p>Typical, elaborate, and linear movie plots engaging emotions, love, and pain are not necessarily recalled in&nbsp;Warhol&rsquo;s non-narrative early films, even as the camera follows the object of its desire into the bedroom. To watch a sleeping person for eight hours is an extremely intimate experience. In&nbsp;Sleep&nbsp;(1963), slow motion creates something like a moving still, unmoving movement and imperceptible action, in Warhol&rsquo;s radically frozen time. The filmed poet John Giorno is no actor; he plays only himself&mdash; another concurrence here, one that demonstrates the fine difference between the performance of real, non-acted life before the documentary camera, and the learned or improvised role enacted when playing someone other than oneself. Warhol&nbsp;understood the subtle difference between performance and acting, documentary and fiction. The individuals placed as objects in front of the camera in&nbsp;Warhol&rsquo;s screen studies chose between &ldquo;being themselves&rdquo; and actively delivering a role. Such is the case in the creative artists&rsquo; portraits that become a caricature: Dal&iacute; is upside-down, and Rosenquist rotates on an imaginary axis that runs between him and the camera.</p>
<p>Warhol&rsquo;s enthusiastic description of this utterly actionless scenario is parallel to the process of&nbsp;Sleep: the dreamlike image of the sleeping John Giorno recreates an intimacy otherwise shared only by a lover who wakes beside his partner, who could stay awake all night watching the object of his love. It&rsquo;s that most intimate, exposed, powerless moment before or after lovemaking&mdash;while the other rests and dreams, defenseless.</p>
