<p>Twenty billion years ago,<br />in the primordial wisdom soup<br />beyond comprehension and indescribable,<br />something without substance moved slightly,<br />and became something imperceptible,<br />moved again and became something invisible,<br />moved again and produced a particle and particles,<br />moved again and became a quark,<br />again and became quarks,<br />moved again and again and became protons and neutrons,<br />and the twelve dimensions of space,<br />tiny fire balls of primordial energy<br />bits tossed back and forth<br />in a game of catch between particles,<br />transmitting electromagnetic light<br />and going fast, 40 million times a second,<br />where the pebble hits the water,<br />that is where the trouble began,<br />something without substance became something with substance,<br />why did it happen?<br />because something substance less<br />had a feeling of missing out on something,<br />not<br />getting it<br />was not getting it<br />not getting it,<br />not getting it,<br />imperceptibly not having something<br />when there was nothing to have,<br />clinging to a notion of reality;<br />from the primordially endless potential,<br />to modern day reality,<br />twenty billion years later,<br />has produced me,<br />gave birth to me and my stupid grasping mind,<br />made me and you and my grasping mind.</p>
<p>May Rinpoche and all the great Tibetan teachers who loved me,<br />come back and love you more,<br />hold you in their wisdom heart&rsquo;s,<br />bathe you in all-pervasive compassion,<br />give you pith instructions,<br />and may you with the diligence of Olympic athletes<br />do meditation practice,<br />and may you with direct confidence<br />realize the true nature of mind.</p>
<p>America, thanks for the neglect,<br />I did it without you,<br />let us celebrate poetic justice,<br />you and I never were,<br />never tried to do anything,<br />and never succeeded,<br />I want to thank you for introducing me to<br />the face of the naked mind,<br />thanx 4 nothing.</p>
