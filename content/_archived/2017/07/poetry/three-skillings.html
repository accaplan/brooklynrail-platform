<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matron of No</strong></p>
<p>There are so many paintings of Lucretia <br>   stabbing herself and they&rsquo;re all <br>   pretty terrific. My personal favorites <br>   are the ones where she looks bored (Rembrandt,<br>   Parmigianino, Sellaer, Cranach <br>   the Elder) like she&rsquo;s just sticking <br>   a casual reminder <br>   between her tits that life is suffering, <br>   and a certain quota of daily blood <br>   is needed for a decant into that ancient <br>   ceremonial chalice of feminine shame. Drip </p> <p>drip. Reclining on a sofa in the mid-century style <br>   I allow a stranger&rsquo;s black and white boy cat <br>   with bright pink rubber caps on all its claws <br>   and a clipped tail to knead a soft space, this shelf <br>   of fat above my organs. It feels invasive <br>   but not unpleasant, a therapy <br>   taken in foggy discomfort.</p> <p>Caught in my phone&rsquo;s own beam<br>   is my greasy face, which, downturned, <br>   admires the Expressionist skyscraper<br>   proposed but never built<br>   by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe <br>   for Berlin&rsquo;s Friedrichstra&szlig;e, its points <br>   pointing at an overgrowth in me,<br>   my finger hovering over the street,<br>   no vehicles below, no people,<br>   the black smudge of city movement<br>   implying by erasure<br>   those who move through <br>   its striated, dynamic soot. </p> <p>And what of the top? A blade garden.<br>   Full of women seeking aesthetic revenge.<br>   I think I might like to go away.<br>   I think I might like to bond <br>   with the darkest stuff, revisit the peeling corner <br>   that exists in almost every room,<br>   and is exquisite artwork that nobody looks at&#151;<br>   to sit with it awhile until a feeling of lateral<br>   motion takes over, a whisk <br>   into a syncretion of senses <br>   from different legendary themes.</p> <p>And now the cat is on the dining room table<br>   licking goat cheese from an earthenware bowl. <br>   The big windows let the night in on a timer.<br>   The room does its thing to me again. <br>   &ldquo;Your lips / your eyes.&rdquo; That gentle shuffle <br>   of petals across the brain.&#8195;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong></p><p>On this day I have chosen place.</p><p>On this day with the sun and the wimpy field,<br>I eye a patch in the middle of the square<br>where the dry brown grass has not yet intruded.</p><p>The approach is nearly painless.<br>One foot, then the other, and so on,<br>until some might say I&rsquo;m there.</p><p>A woman I&rsquo;ve met many times waves<br>from the sidewalk in front of the bank,<br>but I do not wave. I remove my shoes,</p><p>though it seems someone else is doing this for me.</p> <p>The transition from motion to motionlessness<br>is about release and alignment.</p><p>I think of the small circular movements of my pelvis,<br>
the clenching of my hamstrings,<br>a twitch in my eyelid,<br> as the smallest deaths,</p><p>dissipating, winding down towards<br>the possibility of stillness, levitating it<br>like a yellow marble<br> behind my eye.</p><p>A predatory bird circles overhead<br>and a small round door<br> opens at the bottom of each of my heels.</p> <p>Two metal screws emerge to begin<br>
their deep descent into the earth below.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re wondering whether this hurts, it does.</p><p>And next there&rsquo;s this impenetrable enclosure<br>(picture a bulletproof aquarium, a cube)<br>it builds slowly around my body, filling <br>with a clear and wonderful liquid<br>that smells of paper and lavender and glue.</p><p>Another native bird with a red head <br>sticks its tiny pink tongue<br>into a pinecone in a nearby tree.</p><p>People begin to run towards me, shouting<br>from the periphery. This only accelerates</p> <p>a process. I am not a man</p> <p>on a horse. I am not a man with a sword.<br> I didn&rsquo;t put out any fires. The tide of resin<br>has reached my &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s peak,&rdquo;  which my first child<br>called my &ldquo;little dark mountain,&rdquo; and will soon</p><p>encapsulate me. It&rsquo;s all very exciting.</p><p>If you worry about my breathing, don&rsquo;t.<br>Monuments breathe only pure movement<br>and glance. On this day I have chosen place.</p><p>This day with the sun and the wimpy field,<br>
among idiots and liars and grotesque snobs,</p><p>and what I did and what I did not do.</p><p>And I say to this place, get used to me.<br>I have nothing left that didn&rsquo;t come from you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A New Sound</strong></p><p>Oh it was morning and<br>the city broke,<br>and along the edges of its fissures<br>grew a soft, feltlike substance.<br>Somehow, too, it was a sound.<br>Not one I could hear, but one I knew was there,<br>like the drone bookending a breath<br>and the full plushness of pause<br>combining into tone.<br>It waved</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&mdash;much like grass waves, but not quite. This is as close<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;as I can come without harming an idea of it&mdash;</p><p>protecting the painful parts<br>of the city&rsquo;s fresh wounds<br>from the harshness of the air.</p><p>Many citizens were collecting scrapings<br> in glass tubes, some were smelling it<br>or rubbing it into their skin.<br>Lucy, across the deep divide<br>that now ran through the square,<br>claimed it had demonic properties.</p><p>To me, it felt kind and fresh,<br>and I noticed a new lightness in people<br>as they spoke to each other about it<br> and what it was<br>and what it would do.</p><p>I bent down,<br>recorded it on my device,<br>heavy and silver in my right hand.<br>I touched it with my left</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;the one with the swelling around the smallest nail,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused by repeated picking at the site,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an anxious habit I&rsquo;d quarantined to one finger&mdash;</p><p>and some of the sound came off <br>on the crepe material of my dress.</p><p>Bluish smear of soft filings<br>heralding the unknown,<br>a prelude buried in its texture.</p><p>I returned home, taking the longest route<br>along a new northeast crevice.<br>The sun seemed closer than usual.<br>Light tumbled down buildings<br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&mdash;how we love in the Capitol<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is often, I thought, determined<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by vectors, ratios, scarcity,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fumes, colors, pockets of air.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I may not even see &ldquo;you,&rdquo;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;you&rdquo; whom I may come to love<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and do not yet know,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if how we spend our pay,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if how we make our wages,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is not predetermined to be connected,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the points where we make our daily stops<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fail to become intersections<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that collect to form a field of relation&mdash;</p><p>I plugged my device<br> into an even larger device<br>to download the file,<br>put on my headphones,<br>pressed play,<br>turned the sound up.</p><p>At first, nothing.<br>Then, horns ascending in layers,<br>stepped gardens of strings.<br>I could hear shifts in the pelvis<br> around the bow&rsquo;s movement,<br>the muffle of moss and dirt<br>and the shoots breaking through them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a new time, I thought,<br>as I texted my friend<br>in the other district,<br>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a new time!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&mdash;imagining briefly the potatoes<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;d bought, collected in the cool dark<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of their drawer, how<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they might never again<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;be exposed to light&mdash;</p><p>The recording continued,<br>but a new sound took its place in me,<br>a converging of voices<br>weaving<br>on the lowest setting.</p><p>It went something like this:</p><p>We don&rsquo;t want to go to work anymore<br>We don&rsquo;t want to go to work anymore<br>We don&rsquo;t want to<br>Don&rsquo;t want to go</p><p>And something within me</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;or perhaps directly behind&mdash;</p><p>began to sing alongside it:</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want<br>I don&rsquo;t want to go<br>I don&rsquo;t want to go to work<br>I don&rsquo;t want to work<br>anymore to go<br> anymore, anymore</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
