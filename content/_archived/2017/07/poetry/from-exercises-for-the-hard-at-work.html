Sept 2, 2015)</strong></p><p>I shimmy, I dodge, I cry, I move on, I read my dictionary, I study the French language, it&rsquo;s the debris of life that floats on the surface, the sea is beyond the law, I shimmy, I dodge, the beautiful, slender, nice, smiling, white women of the advertisements inspire me to learn the French language, to buy shampoo, to do yoga, but I stay here, I read my dictionary, I read &ldquo;shimmy,&rdquo; I read &ldquo;dodge,&rdquo; how does one shimmy? how does one dodge? I&rsquo;ve no friends here, but I eat my velvety yogurt with the index finger of my right hand, to my right, no law, so I move to the left, I move toward the interior, to the back, to the top, I won&rsquo;t stay here, maybe it won&rsquo;t be better there, I shimmy, I dodge, I move on, move on, move on, I search, I cry, it&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;m not complaining, I&rsquo;ll get by, I eat my velvety yogurt with my finger, the index finger of my right hand, it&rsquo;s OK, mister, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m going, I shimmy, I dodge, I search, I cry, I move on.</p><br><p>--from Paris</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
