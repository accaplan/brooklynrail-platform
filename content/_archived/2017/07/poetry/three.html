<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Poem Excluding Change</strong><br><br>   Today every person in the world <br>   is born again, again. Every single <br>   person in the entire world is wearing <br>   a black t-shirt storming <br>   the nearest shoreline. <br>   Today, summer is slang <br>   for summer, is locked inside <br>   every parked car in the city <br>   and the wind is nothing more <br>   than a brilliant collection of sighs. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Poem Excluding Opposite Day</strong><br><br>   Every thought you have becomes <br>   the future tattoos of sad children <br>   in federally funded afterschool<br>   programs. The river gets a life <br>   and then burns. People wait <br>   in line to give blood, to devour <br>   the future. Bird songs carve <br>   through the air until sunset. <br>   It&rsquo;s always December <br>   in the next chapter of your life, <br>   your thoughts slowly replaced <br>   by freezing rain. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Poem Excluding Air Quotes</strong><br><br>   Start with how your father died. <br>   In the hospital, his legs <br>   couldn&rsquo;t even whisper beneath <br>   the thin sheets. You sat in a plastic <br>   chair and took in a view of the parking <br>   garage. The hallway was busy <br>   with the occasional sound of toddlers <br>   chasing balloons, of nurses, fake smiles. <br>   You decorated his bedside with a get-<br>   well card from an ex-wife, a tall glass <br>   of ice water. When he passed, you <br>   wondered how many people <br>   had died in this room, <br>   on this bed, <br>   at this time of night<br>   when the darkness was making<br>   a meal of the world. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
