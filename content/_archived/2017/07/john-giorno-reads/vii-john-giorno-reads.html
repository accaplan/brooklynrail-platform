title: VII. JOHN GIORNO READS
---

<p>&ldquo;I moved here after I got back from Tangier, thinking that I was going to be here for a month, or at the most three months. I had no idea that I was going to spend the rest of my life here,&rdquo; John Giorno once said of his home at 222 Bowery, where he has lived since 1966. The building is now a hallowed place within American culture: an artist cooperative that has been inhabited by generations including Fernand L&eacute;ger, Mark Rothko, William Burroughs, and Lynda Benglis, and which is still in use today. It is with such a consideration of the arts community saturating the bones of this building&mdash;and, more pointedly, of how space both defines and is defined by what happens within&mdash;that Rirkrit Tiravanija made <em>untitled 2008 (John Giorno reads)</em>, an artwork whose enclosed structure features a film of the artist and poet in a scale model of a portion of his Bowery home.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Tiravanija made the film over a series of days spent in Giorno&rsquo;s loft, capturing him while performing poems, playing records by the John Giorno Band, and reading sections of his memoirs as published in <em>You Got to Burn to Shine: New and Selected Writings </em>(1993). These passages come together in the work as a series of edited clips (originally ten reels of 16mm film, now digitized to over ten hours of video) that evoke personal and art history, a powerfully intimate presence and a public persona. The documentation all shares the same frame, situating Giorno between his bed and his own paintings, with phrases such as LIFE IS A KILLER. These are fitting bookends for a meditation on Giorno&rsquo;s life, and mortality itself. As Giorno recounts stories about his time with Warhol, what appears at first to be a performance reveals itself to be a personal exchange with Tiravanija&mdash;its sentiment confirmed as Giorno gives a small smile and almost bashfully says thank you at the conclusion of each poem, reminding the viewer of Tiravanija&rsquo;s invisible presence behind the camera. The video is projected in the structure as it was filmed in the loft, so that the viewer sitting on Mark Handforth&rsquo;s bench takes up Tiravanija&rsquo;s place as Giorno&rsquo;s intimate audience.</p>
<p>While<em> untitled 2008</em> highlights the importance of Giorno&rsquo;s relationships&mdash;showing how deeply his life has been interwoven with the lives of his friends throughout the arts&mdash; the sheer magnetism of Giorno in performance and among friends is documented in eighty-eight photographs by Fran&ccedil;oise Janicot on view nearby; as well as in Joan Wallace&rsquo;s sculptural portrait of Giorno, which recalls his appearance in Warhol&rsquo;s 1963 film <em>Sleep</em>. In all of these works, one notes how Giorno is continually addressing others. As Tiravanija has remarked about his own work, &ldquo;It is not what you see that is important, but what takes place between people.&rdquo; This credo has been a guiding principle for Giorno as well, and it is an honor to be able to share it as part of <em>I </em><em><span style="font-family: NimbusSanRegIta;">&hearts;</span> John Giorno</em>.</p>
