title: THERE WAS A BAD TREE
---

!!img1!!<p>There was a bad<br />tree<br />a bad tree,<br />that people<br />hated.<br />The leaves gave off<br />a foul<br />smell,<br />and the flowers<br />had a bitter<br />stink.<br />If you got too close,<br />you vomited.<br />The fruit<br />was poison,<br />one bite<br />and you were dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone really<br />disliked it.<br />The bad tree<br />stunk.<br />They talked<br />endlessly about it;<br />and decided<br />to cut it down.<br />Get rid of it.<br />They chopped<br />with axes,<br />and barely made a dent;<br />wearing breathing masks,<br />they whacked at it<br />and whacked at it,<br />and nibbled and chipped.<br />Oily powder<br />from the shiny dark green leaves,<br />got on their skin,<br />blistered,<br />and was really itchy;<br />and they scratched<br />bloody red.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They put on<br />protective gear<br />with oxygen,<br />and went at it with<br />electric buzz saws<br />and heavy equipment.<br />Working 24-hour shifts,<br />finally, they cut it down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone was very happy,<br />and celebrated<br />the great victory.<br />A noble deed, well done;<br />and they went to bed exhausted.<br />The next morning,<br />the bad tree<br />had grown back,<br />had sprung up<br />new and bigger,<br />and more beautiful<br />and ugly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was very discouraging.<br />They talked a lot about it,<br />and cut it down again,<br />and poured gasoline on the roots,<br />and burned all the leaves and branches<br />in a big fire.<br />After the smoldering embers<br />got cold,<br />the tree grew back,<br />bigger,<br />more bad,<br />and really gorgeous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other people<br />had been watching<br />from their houses,<br />waiting their turn.<br />They thought themselves<br />smarter,<br />with higher intellectual<br />capabilities,<br />they knew how<br />to get rid of the tree.<br />It was a growing plant,<br />a wood tree<br />that grew in the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They incinerated it,<br />burned the roots<br />with chemicals,<br />vaporizing acids,<br />and robotic lasers;<br />detonated<br />on the ground,<br />bombed<br />from the air,<br />hit<br />with smart missiles;<br />and bombarded<br />with radiation.<br />They made<br />a fire storm;<br />and covered the ground<br />with concrete<br />and steel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tree grew back,<br />more fresh,<br />more elegant, even gracious;<br />and really ugly.<br />The wood was<br />harder,<br />darker,<br />more shiny,<br />thick hot muscle;<br />and the leaves,<br />full and lush,<br />moved like underwater plants<br />luxuriously in the breeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone was very depressed,<br />extremely discouraged.<br />It was a catastrophe.<br />They had made for themselves<br />a hell world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They talked incessantly about it,<br />and came to a big decision.<br />The Mayor resigned<br />in disgrace,<br />and those, who had worked<br />so hard,<br />left,<br />humiliated,<br />departed,<br />moved to the other side of town,<br />stayed away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, out of the blue, appeared<br />these beautiful people.<br />They were simple<br />and humble,<br />and a little like peacocks,<br />and seemingly well-intentioned,<br />with a great sense of humor.<br />Radiantly relaxed,<br />oozing<br />loving kindness<br />and compassion,<br />they walked right up,<br />and started eating<br />the leaves.<br />They ate the leaves<br />and enjoyed them,<br />became happy,<br />and laughed<br />and laughed;<br />and chomped on more leaves.<br />You could tell they really<br />liked the taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They pressed<br />their cheeks<br />to the flowers,<br />black velvet<br />coated with transmission oil.<br />They licked<br />the sweet juices<br />that seeped<br />from the petals.<br />The pollen<br />was coal dust<br />and petroleum gas.<br />Burying their noses,<br />they sucked<br />in deep breaths,<br />eating<br />the smell,<br />great bliss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They discovered The fruit<br />hidden beneath the leaves,<br />overripe mangoes<br />with sticky eggplant skin,<br />hung like testicles;<br />and inside The fruit<br />was rotting meat,<br />like liver.<br />The special people<br />got their faces<br />into the stinking slime,<br />and really got into it;<br />inhaling with their lips,<br />and teeth,<br />and tongues.<br />They licked and drank<br />the thick red juice.<br />The seeds,<br />like cabochon rubies,<br />seemed particularly potent,<br />and were chewed<br />with great delight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fruit contained<br />the five wisdoms.<br />The men and women<br />became luminous,<br />their skin was golden<br />and their bodies,<br />almost transparent,<br />were clothed in shimmering<br />rainbow lights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They became sleepy,<br />yawned, and curled up<br />under the tree,<br />and a took a nap.<br />While they slept,<br />music filled the air.<br />Lounging<br />against the gnarled tree trunk<br />and protruding roots,<br />their huge bodies<br />colored red, yellow,<br />blue, green, white,<br />rested in<br />great equanimity,<br />and radiated<br />huge compassion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the tree<br />were the secret homes<br />of many demi-gods,<br />hungry ghosts,<br />and earth spirits,<br />who were very pleased<br />with all the positive attention<br />being paid them.<br />After years of abuse,<br />mutilation,<br />and destruction,<br />they were thrilled;<br />even though, they were being ravaged<br />and their flowers<br />wrecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the root endings,<br />there were jewels,<br />diamonds and emeralds and rubies,<br />which were stars in the sky<br />of the world below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beautiful men and women<br />woke up,<br />and nibbled on the leaves, again.<br />They ate the leaves,<br />like deer,<br />pausing between bites,<br />looking up<br />at the vast<br />empty sky.<br />The leaves and fruit<br />increased their clarity<br />and bliss,<br />and introduced the nature<br />of primordially pure<br />wisdom mind.</p>
