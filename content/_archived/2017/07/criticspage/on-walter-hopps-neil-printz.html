title: On Walter Hopps
---

<p>I met Walter Hopps in September 1975 during my year as a museum fellow at the National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington D.C. (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum). I began my fellowship with the exhibits crew, installing an exhibition of contemporary American sculpture that was organized by a curator who had recently left the museum. I never met her but she was very lucky&#151;and so was I&#151;since Walter Hopps took over the project and installed the show. I was straight out of grad school and I had never seen anyone like him; there was the chain-smoking, nervous pacing that everyone remembers, but also the laser-like attention and care he took with each object, the utter finesse of the final installation. At one moment, I remember him turning to the chief of the exhibits crew, a guy who was notoriously tuned-out, and saying something like: &ldquo;This time John, it&rsquo;s going to be down to inches.&rdquo;</p> <p>I spent the last half of my fellowship in the department of 20th-century painting and sculpture. When Walter finally turned up, he invited me into his office straight away. He asked me where I&rsquo;d gone to school and what the subject of my Master&rsquo;s thesis had been. When I replied the University of Michigan and told him that I had written my thesis about 18th-century fashion plates and images of fashion, I thought I saw him flinch, just for a second, before he asked me if I liked Rauschenberg&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I answered. His next question was: &ldquo;Do you want to play hardball or softball?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not big on sports metaphors, so I probably flinched this time but knew enough to shoot back, &ldquo;Hardball.&rdquo; My life changed and my postgraduate education began, working for him on the retrospective of Rauschenberg&rsquo;s work he was organizing for the museum. One day when I complained about the difficulties of trying to record the media in a Rauschenberg combine painting, which he insisted had to be catalogued in systematic detail, he answered that curatorial work was basically &ldquo;nitpicky and labor-intensive.&rdquo; Down to inches, you might say.</p> <p>Playing &ldquo;hardball&rdquo; meant working late, working day and night, in fact. One evening as we were leaving the museum, we passed through the 19th-century galleries where George Catlin&rsquo;s Indian paintings were hanging. I remember him asking me what I thought of Catlin, as we were crossing 8th Street outside the museum. I replied too glibly that I thought they were interesting but that I didn&rsquo;t think they were good paintings. &ldquo;It depends on what you mean by good painting,&rdquo; he replied. </p>
