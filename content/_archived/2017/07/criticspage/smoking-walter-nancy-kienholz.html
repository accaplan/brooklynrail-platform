title: Smoking Walter
---

<p>There are so many memories associated with Walter. Let&rsquo;s just think about how he smoked. He held his cigarette between his middle and ring finger leaving all other fingers open. He would very slowly raise his cigarette to his mouth thus covering his mouth with his hand. It always fascinated me to watch him smoke.&nbsp; He was the only person I have ever known who smoked like that. He, like I, loved smoking and we smoked our way around the world together. </p>
