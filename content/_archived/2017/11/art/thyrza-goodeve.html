title: EDITOR'S NOTEThyrza Nichols Goodeve

<p>Last week, as though the news for feminists and women of the art world(s) wasn&rsquo;t grim enough (the Weinstein allegations of abusive horror ballooning into overwhelming quantities; <em>Artforum</em> publisher Knight Landsman served with a damning lawsuit followed by the resignation of longtime female editor Michelle Kuo, not to mention the daily obscenity of our never-to-repent pussy-grabbing President), we learn of the passing of Linda Nochlin. Few scholars change the course of living history as she did in 1971 when she published, &ldquo;Why Are There No Great Women Artists&rdquo; &ndash;a fact noted by the many writers in the art world who have written movingly about her influence. We at <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em> are honored to publish the following personal anecdotes and reminiscences from only a few of the many whose lives were touched by Nochlin.</p>
