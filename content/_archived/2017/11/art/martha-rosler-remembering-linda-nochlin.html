<p>I knew Linda Nochlin for many years from &ldquo;around&rdquo;&mdash;around the feminist art community, I suppose is what I mean, and also from her days at the Institute. Once, as we wandered to the refreshments area after a talk I gave there about my work, she said, &ldquo;You always say you&rsquo;re from Crown Heights, but you never say where.&rdquo; Perplexed, I answered &ldquo;Crown Street,&rdquo; wondering about her unexpected interest in provincial Brooklyn. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;but where? <em>Where</em> on Crown Street? I&rsquo;m from Crown Street, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;250,&rdquo; overlapping her own &ldquo;250.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I repeated more slowly, &ldquo;250." She stared at me. &ldquo;No, <em>I&rsquo;m</em> from 250. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m</em> from 250.&rdquo; Silence&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, we were both from 250 Crown Street, a six-story apartment building with two wings and two elevators. &ldquo;But I never knew you!&rdquo; I objected. She had left, it seems, while I was too small to know much.</p>
<p>We exchanged a few words about the building and the neighborhood. As I was continuing to chatter on about the place and the great apartment we managed to get after many years, she interjected: &ldquo;My grandfather <em>built</em> that building.&rdquo;</p> <div class="photogallery"> !!img2!!</div>
