<p>&ldquo;The T-shirt made a kind of social debut in the 1950s, a literal &lsquo;coming out&rsquo; from concealment as&nbsp;an undergarment to attitude-intensive outerwear,&rdquo; according to artist and satirist Pippa Garner. In its early days, the blankness of the T-shirt&mdash;its plain white, James Dean look&mdash;signaled a spirit of refusal. &ldquo;Any kind of inscription or image would have seemed d&eacute;class&eacute;, recalling the depression-era sandwich board (a strap-on set of advertising panels by which a hard-up individual could earn a sandwich, by emulating one).&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> Today, the T-shirt has embraced the work of the sandwich board, gamely delivering&nbsp;corporate slogans, catchy witticisms, and expressions of personal or political affiliation.</p>
<p>At the Brooklyn Museum&rsquo;s new pop-up gift shop, the T-shirt works overtime as art object, protest gear, and swag. Conceived&nbsp;by&nbsp;artist Marilyn Minter and curator and art historian Andrianna Campbell, <em>Anger Management&nbsp;</em>features artist-designed, resistance-themed T-shirts and other merchandise that respond to a growing culture of violence, repression, and fear in the United States.&nbsp;For those&nbsp;enraged or imperiled by the current presidential administration, the work offers&nbsp;a kind of retail therapy.</p>
<p>Some of the artists repurpose historical slogans (&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T TREAD ON ME&rdquo;) or codify internet&nbsp;memes&nbsp;(&ldquo;NASTY WOMAN&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&ldquo;SHE PERSISTED&rdquo;). Other pieces, like Andrea Geyer&rsquo;s multi-pronged emblem&nbsp;of equity and inclusion, imagine&nbsp;new, intersectional iconography. There are Pictures Generation cut-ups and sampling: stickers and postcards from Jenny Holzer, a T-shirt by Barbara&nbsp;Kruger, and glitch art wrapping paper by Louise Lawler for the unnerving present. Though much of the work is text-based&mdash;even from social experimenter Rirkrit Tiravanija&mdash;there&rsquo;s a neon light installation by Jonathan Horowitz, priced in the five-figure range, and Rashid Johnson&rsquo;s spin on museum gift shop fare: a silk scarf printed with scenes of martial combat from his short film, <em>The New Black Yoga.</em></p>
<p>The work addresses urgent political concerns: attacks&nbsp;on the EPA, racial violence,&nbsp;threats to the rights of&nbsp;women and workers, discrimination against&nbsp;the LGBTQ community, and the immigration ban. Because the museum&rsquo;s nonprofit status bars political campaigning, the artists don&rsquo;t name names. Instead, they deliver their anger or dread by blunt epigram: &ldquo;NO FLAG&rdquo; (Trevor Paglen),&nbsp;&ldquo;RUN FOR YOUR LIFE&rdquo; (Rob Pruitt), &ldquo;THIS IS NOT AMERICA&rdquo; (critics Jerry&nbsp;Saltz&nbsp;and Roberta Smith), &ldquo;GRAB &lsquo;EM BY THE BALLOTS&rdquo; (Zoe Buckman), &ldquo;ALL LIES MATTER&rdquo; (Hank Willis Thomas), and &ldquo;RESIST&rdquo; (Marilyn Minter). Andrew Kuo&rsquo;s&nbsp;black-and-white sweatshirts say &ldquo;SAD.&rdquo; They bring to mind the wonderfully weird merch of comic Maria Bamford: her giant pair of gym shorts&nbsp;that say &ldquo;SHY!&rdquo; These are forms of abjection written on the body&mdash;rhetorical resistance to corporate messaging about achievement or&nbsp;<em>winning</em>.&nbsp;This is clothing as political combat. (&ldquo;To strike a pose is to pose a threat&rdquo; (Dick&nbsp;Hebdige.))</p>
<p>But are feelings political? Which feelings and whose?&nbsp;White anger vented on Twitter in the name of patriotism&nbsp;may be&nbsp;given political status&nbsp;or publicly rewarded&nbsp;in&nbsp;a way that the anger of a black man&nbsp;on the football field&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;<em>Anger Management</em>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t really about the strategic deployment of feelings for political ends. Or it is. It straddles&nbsp;the twin meanings of the Greek&nbsp;<em>agora</em>: &ldquo;I speak in public&rdquo; and &ldquo;I shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pop-up project arrives at the Brooklyn Museum during <em>A Year of Yes</em>, a series of exhibitions and public programming dedicated to the history of feminism and feminist art, from<em> A Woman&rsquo;s Afterlife: Gender Transformation in Ancient Egypt</em> to this summer&rsquo;s <em>We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965-85</em>. <em>Anger Management&nbsp;</em>shares first-floor space with <em>The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America</em>, an exhibition examining the roots of America&rsquo;s carceral system in the history of black lynching.&nbsp;These exhibitions and programming reflect the museum&rsquo;s commitment to institutional critique&mdash;and a willingness to engage with&nbsp;the contradictions and complexities of this enterprise.</p>
<p>Here,&nbsp;political speech&nbsp;is for sale:&nbsp;buttons, stickers, iron-on patches&mdash;the sort of throwaway objects&nbsp;historically&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;as part of a grassroots medium of exchange. The Museum takes a twenty-five percent cut of the proceeds, with the remainder divided among the artists and distributed to charities of their choice.&nbsp;You won&rsquo;t see this sort of thing uptown at the Met. But it&rsquo;s a quick walk from countercultural critique to institutional embrace. Somewhere in suburban New Jersey, there&rsquo;s a teenager sporting Shepard Fairey&rsquo;s dissident mantra&nbsp;OBEY&nbsp;alongside Nike&rsquo;s corporate swoosh.</p>
