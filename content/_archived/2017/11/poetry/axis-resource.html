title: AXIS RESOURCE
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had to create my own ancestors.</p>
<p>I dumped the Eshlemans decades ago, never met the Spencers.</p>
<p>Intuiting that it was impossible to ignite sacred fire off oneself,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Powell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vallejo, Coatlicue, Yorunomado.</p>
<p>These eidola I placed around me, a cromlech of mouth stones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orphic beheadeds&mdash;</p>

<p>Once the self is constellated, meaning comes with it.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>With a seriously sick beloved</p>
<p>the temptation is to worry like a wasp queen missing her nest</p>
<p>or a Seibel lord who&rsquo;s lost his spirit jaguar.</p>
<p>I have been going not crazy but dull nutty for nearly a year.</p>
<p>I translate to keep my mind alive.</p>
<p>I must organize my ogre, let him express what I cannot divine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O ogre, deal Caryl a decent hand!</p>
<p>Caryl who has lived her own life in the context of ours 40 years,</p>
<p>&amp; she is a fine drawer &amp; made beautiful jewelry.</p>
<p>She has enabled me, in exercising my charnel grounds, to make the most of them.</p>
<p>How much I owe to her, how much I owe to myself spurred on by her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going over worksheet after worksheet with me, at the table in the morning after</p>
<p> coffee, asking me thousands of questions: what did I mean by this, why did I write</p>
<p>that, helping me to narrow down the infernal discrepancy between what I thought I</p>
<p>had written &amp; what I did write. While I went into the labyrinth on my own &amp;</p>
<p>sometimes emerged, at the center you were the companion providing resistance,</p>
<p>neither Minotaur nor Falconress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your assemblage in the dining room corner: on an old ironing board a wooden</p>
<p>skateboard holding up your sculpture of my head in unfired clay, flanked by a</p>
<p>stuffed rabbit lady &amp; a photo of a white gorilla. Beyond, at each end of the</p>
<p>skateboard, a <em>tanuki </em>with ground-length balls, sake jug, &amp; chin-tied straw hat&mdash;&amp;</p>
<p>a pot-bellied Balinese wood frog with a leaf parasol. Scattered about on the ironing</p>
<p>board: a clay Oaxacan lady holding a duck &amp; a squash with a cut watermelon on</p>
<p>her head by Jos&eacute;fina Aquilar, many little pigs (falling on their backs, doing head</p>
<p>stands), a 19<sup>th</sup> century iron that used coal, a rabbit with a carrot candlestick, &amp; a</p>
<p>salt and pepper set of two little fat rabbits. This is our <em>ofrenda.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your gold ring which you designed &amp; cast, with its undulant creased leaf base</p>
<p>mounted with a rosette encased with a garnet &amp; a half-moon of seven tiny</p>
<p>diamonds; across the diamondless third of the rosette, a furrowed sweep of gold,</p>
<p>carotene river as close to me as the Styx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look for words for what being inside of you is, the thought makes me shake.</p> <p>Empty quivers like Songs of Songs volley about. To place myself inside you &amp; not</p>
<p>hurt you, to be at the heart of your life, to slightly know you where only you know</p>
<p>yourself, to have this billygoat extension encased, a warm oar as if in the first the</p>
<p>very first waters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fullness of life&mdash;as set against the void&mdash;how to measure it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a spring 1963 Kyoto party, Gary Snyder dancing with the host while</p> <p>throwing the guy&rsquo;s shoji screens out into the creek behind the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to honor Antonin Artaud strolling Blvd Montparnasse, 1947, his arm</p>
<p>around 16 year old Florence Loeb, offering her avuncular advice about virginity!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or the expression on Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire&rsquo;s face as he scurried across a trafficked street</p>
<p>near the Sorbonne, 1978, while accompanying me to a caf&eacute; where he would</p>
<p>respond to my list of translator questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such moments are so rich, so close to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a dear kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life swells,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percolates&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 December 2010</p>
