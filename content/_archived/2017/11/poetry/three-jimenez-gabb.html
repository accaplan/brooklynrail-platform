<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TOTALITY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know exactly when</p>
<p>the moon will pass again</p>
<p>between the sun and the earth</p>
<p>and again years from now</p>
<p>the details of totality</p>
<p>we know it will be</p>
<p>a narrow path across Earth</p>
<p>we know we will again be</p>
<p>older and wearing special glasses</p>
<p>bought from special places</p>
<p>to shield our eyes</p>
<p>the only way to really see</p>
<p>and how far west</p>
<p>we must go</p>
<p>in this country</p>
<p>I know my parents</p>
<p>drove us across</p>
<p>one summer these states</p>
<p>I knew they were teachers</p>
<p>that they were part</p>
<p>of the system</p>
<p>that there was this</p>
<p>thing called system</p>
<p>because it was a word</p>
<p>that they used often</p>
<p>and it meant something</p>
<p>about the way they were</p>
<p>allowed to love us</p>
<p>and each other</p>
<p>a whole summer long</p>
<p>to keep getting paid</p>
<p>I came to know the history</p>
<p>of this system</p>
<p>and some of the key</p>
<p>players who shaped it</p>
<p>a certain way</p>
<p>so that many years</p>
<p>from then</p>
<p>we could have mothers</p>
<p>and fathers who worked</p>
<p>or didn't work</p>
<p>or none to drive us</p>
<p>or dying</p>
<p>to drive us across</p>
<p>the contiguous states</p>
<p>with some money to pay</p>
<p>to look out at the world</p>
<p>from on top of horses</p>
<p>to say this is where</p>
<p>our ancestors stood</p>
<p>at the system coming</p>
<p>for them worse</p>
<p>than the seasons</p>
<p>I knew a great many things</p>
<p>by what state they were in</p>
<p>after work</p>
<p>still willing</p>
<p>the word system</p>
<p>and though they knew</p>
<p>a certain comfort there</p>
<p>they knew of other systems</p>
<p>in other places</p>
<p>and had studied</p>
<p>this system</p>
<p>its laws of motion</p>
<p>to know it was a certainty</p>
<p>the day would come here</p>
<p>they talked about it often</p>
<p>with their friends</p>
<p>from iran and panama</p>
<p>who were brought here</p>
<p>by the same system</p>
<p>also to study its malfunction</p>
<p>you come to know</p>
<p>when to look up</p>
<p>into space</p>
<p>in the future</p>
<p>for something</p>
<p>that comes only a few</p>
<p>times in a life</p>
<p>you come to know</p>
<p>how bad</p>
<p>and beautiful</p>
<p>can co-exist not forever</p>
<p>we know all of this</p>
<p>but we don't know when</p>
<p>the new system will come</p>
<p>neither the day</p>
<p>nor the year</p>
<p>when we will not need</p>
<p>to buy something else</p>
<p>to see and to be perhaps safer</p>
<p>to know it is there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
