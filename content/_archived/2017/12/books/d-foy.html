<p>An essay I return to often is Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s &#147;Theses on the Philosophy of History,&#148; a piece renowned for its central image: the Angel of History, witnessing the past not as a series of separate events, but as a chaotic singularity&mdash;an infinite trainwreck piled atop itself, unto the end of the world. Paralyzed by this storm we call &#147;progress,&#148; the Angel is driven blindly into the future while gazing with ambivalence on the wreckage of the past. I feel as if D. Foy&#146;s latest novel, <em>Absolutely Golden</em>, were to encounter the Angel of History, it might suggest something like, &#147;Why do you allow the storm to restrain you, dude? You're an angel, after all. Why don't you fly?&#148;</p>
<p><em>Absolutely Golden</em> is a charming, wreckage-strewn reverie set at a Humboldt nudist colony in 1973, back when Reagan was more than an actor and less than a President, when the Summer of Love had turned to autumn (if not winter), and when the gulf between Greek gods at a bacchanal and desperate misfits at a naked cookout lay purely in the eye of the beholder. It is a novel of conflicting mythologies and contradictory personas, of classical music colliding with bebop, of suburban comfort mingling with &#145;60s counterculture&mdash;a nonjudgmental lunge for ecstasy and enlightenment across a landscape of shish kabobs, mind-altering drugs, fondue parties, and copious amounts of asscrack.</p>
<p>The golden-haired witness at its center is Rachel Hill, a widowed schoolteacher and spare-time herpetologist who is convinced by Jack, her mediocre hippie boyfriend, to visit Camp Freedom Lake (along with his last-minute invite, &#147;cousin&#148; Jenny the Ecdysiast, a striptease artist whose presence seemingly relegates Rachel to third wheel).  Before departing, Rachel dyes her hair blonde (at &#147;Earl&rsquo;s Odyssey of Hair,&#148; an appropriate launching point for such a mythic journey) and goes on to make a tremendous splash at the nudist equivalent of her debutante ball. Here, she meets a rogue&#146;s gallery of &#147;righteous cats&#148;: the child preacher-turned-naturist Jomar Links (a thinly-veiled portrait of Marjoe Gortner); Merle Frizzel, a sensitive Donald Duck-enthusiast; and the Hollanders, Wolfgang and Usch, aging Dutch swingers (who possibly allude to the comically oversexed persona of Xaviera Hollander in The Happy Hooker). We even meet a nude jazz musician named Derrick Rolphy with an album called Trout for Brunch (&aacute; la Out to Lunch) and bandmates named Teddy Fubbard and Robbie Kutcherson (&aacute; la Freddie Hubbard and Bobby Hutcherson), in case a mere Eric Dolphy reference was insufficient.</p>
<p>However, Rachel's adventures in open-air extroversion are not without consequence: she soon finds herself the victim of a debilitating sunburn, fit for Icarus. Scorched but not cowed, she begins to navigate the path to her own rebirth (&#147;Once I was a woman at a grave. Now I was a circus, and a girl, real&#148;), and it is a path replete with mythical imagery, of snakes (dicks flopping like propellers, shed skin and molted clothing, pet constrictors and feathered boas, Hydra-like gatekeepers, and coiled sins), of gold (the sun&rsquo;s rays, the Midas Touch, hair revered like a fabled Fleece, of pots at the end of rainbows), and of mysticism (palmistry, tarot, and astrology, and even a Hand of Glory, which appears amid a gruesomely Gothic interlude, perhaps the most vivid of the novel). Among the wreckage of the old world and the new (even the novel&rsquo;s epigraph is written in 20th Century mock-Latin) there are many forking paths to transcendence, and perhaps there can be prizes for winners and losers, both.</p>
<p>Foy unfolds his work with a dreamlike mania, as the wreckage of myth and sex and pop culture piles atop itself, building to a tempestuous spin of the kaleidoscope, and in looking through it, we see a colorful but fractured mess of performance and spontaneity, the divide between our masks and our true selves. It's a breathlessly rendered work, delirious, like a wild rush through a meadow or a ride on a runaway carousel. It possesses a kind of indulgent sincerity and heightened gonzo comedy (a character refers to his dick as a "trippindicular club of horniness," for instance) that recalls the mad poetry and giddy philosophizing of counterculture writers like Tom Robbins or Ken Kesey. It's a symphony of easy listening, and Wagner, and avant-garde jazz; a portrait of dancing priestesses and ecstatic buffoons and weeping dark gods. In gazing upon it in its entirety, I think even the Angel of History might crack a smile.</p>
