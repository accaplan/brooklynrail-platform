title: The Rail's Best Books of 2017
---

<p>In times of terror and turmoil and change, our stories tell us more about ourselves than policies or presidents or predators&mdash;our stories tell us how we endured those moments, those figures, those monsters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of all the story forms the most political is literature. For it travels in the stealthiest of vessels: books. Unlike screens and stages, the human imagination, once word-encountered, never again reads a sentence the same way twice. Repeated readings become recursive events, subversive actions that deepen or even change meaning. Books offer us&nbsp;the alchemy of infinite interpretation.</p>
<p>So this year particularly, 2017,&nbsp;a year of policies, presidents, and predators, I celebrate words and their many stealthy vessels. Far, far, far too many to be reduced to a top 5. I chose my top 25 of the three main genres: poetry, nonfiction, and fiction. I chose books from small, independent presses, those houses we so desperately&nbsp;need and are so lucky to have. I chose from lesser-known authors, in some cases, the untweeted-about, the unawarded, the uncelebrated, the unincluded, the unagented. I chose novellas and chapbooks and limited runs from presses that may not be here next year. I chose those books from this past year that, in my opinion, best teach us how we&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;live, how we <em>will</em>&nbsp;love, how we&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;struggle, how we&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;endure.</p>
<p>They are listed in alphabetical order, and those I was able to assign for coverage in&nbsp;<em>The Brooklyn Rail&nbsp;</em>I have linked. The others I offer to you to search out for yourself, to purchase, to read, to support, to share.</p>
