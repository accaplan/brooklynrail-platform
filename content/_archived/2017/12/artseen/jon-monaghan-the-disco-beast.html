<p style="text-align: center;">BITFORMS GALLERY | OCTOBER 26 &#150; DECEMBER 10, 2017</p>
<p>Jonathan Monaghan&rsquo;s solo show at Bitforms gallery investigates the unicorn as a symbolic being, demonstrating in surprising ways its historical richness, multivalence, and relevance to the digital age. The exhibition&rsquo;s namesake work is an animated video in which a unicorn traverses a deserted landscape of opulently rendered, futuristic luxury environments. Propelled by twin jet engines that emerge from its back, the unicorn descends from the sky into a sterile mall-like development where all is glassy and devoid of human presence. It rides up an escalator into an empty plaza and is suddenly captured by a shape-shifting machine. Trapped within an electromagnetic bubble, the unicorn is held captive inside a decadent, Silicon-Valley-Baroque lobby. Finally, its seemingly dead body emerges from the floor of a disco-themed Starbucks bathroom. To the beat of pulsing electronic music, it rises again and walks solemnly past the caf&eacute; counter to a balcony high in the clouds, taking flight into the sky.</p>!!img1!!
<p>The immediate association of this surreal sequence is the story of flight, capture, and rebirth from the the Cloisters museum&rsquo;s beloved Unicorn Tapestries. The medieval unicorn hunt depicted in these seven weavings, which have strongly influenced the canonization of the unicorn in the western imagination, is a magnum opus of luxurious detail. In Monaghan&rsquo;s hyper-detailed animated architectures there is a similar&mdash;or, at least, aspirationally similar&mdash; sense of intensive, fastidious labor. A second, more contemporary association I can&rsquo;t help making is triggered by the virtual Starbucks, which here recalls the coffee chain&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited-time-only&rdquo; <em>Unicorn Frappucino,</em> a hideous color-changing &lsquo;blended cr&egrave;me&rsquo; drink that was released earlier this year. With this concoction, Starbucks slapped its mark of hyper-commercial uncoolness upon the whimsical #unicorn trend that had been saturating mainstream social networks with rainbow hair, rainbow food, holographic cosmetics, and an abundance of glitter.&nbsp;</p>
!!img2!!<p>With these references to the unicorn motif, both iconic and trivial, Monaghan seems to invite a transhistorical consideration of its symbolism. Situated within the animated environment, the unicorn has the potential to embody the blurring boundaries of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; in the digital age; does the imaginary animal in virtual space become virtually real? It&rsquo;s possible that the internet gives the unicorn more potency than ever. Years before Monaghan&rsquo;s show, it emerged as a significant motif in internet culture, spawning with the <em>My Little Pony </em>franchise and the viral meme &ldquo;Charlie the Unicorn.&rdquo; But its continuing popularity seems to stem deeply from millennial childhood nostalgia, and from its unabashed whimsy that so aptly embodies the absurdist humor and escapism of the internet. What&rsquo;s compelling about Monaghan&rsquo;s work is that his unicorn is a creature whose existence is predicated on the symbolic continuum of past and present.</p>
<p>The artist&rsquo;s narrative parallel to the medieval unicorn hunt is amplified into the present with a tiny sculpture of a porcelain unicorn corralled within a golden enclosure. Upon close inspection, the gilded barrier is actually a ring of 3D-printed baggage x-ray machines. The unicorn has always been an elusive object of desire that some, as the Cloisters tapestries demonstrate, will inevitably try to find and seize. It remains a prize to covet within the contemporary reality evoked by Monaghan&rsquo;s golden x-rays, one in which militarized and commodified surveillance is crucially abetted by the tech industry; in venture capital lingo, a &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; is a private company valued at over a billion dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A standout sculpture is the<em> Unicorn in Bondage </em>(2017)<em>, </em>a marble form resembling an upholstered phallus with a delicate gold horn protruding from its top. Compared to the flat, cold, digital textures of Monaghan&rsquo;s animated environments, there&rsquo;s something intensely sensual about this object. Though it remains rooted in new media techniques&mdash;it was carved by a CNC machine based on a 3D model&mdash;the artist hand-finished the Carrara marble to remove the tell-tale scour marks of the digital chisel. The resulting topography of the sculpture&rsquo;s button-tufted surface is downright fleshy. It&rsquo;s an erotic form, again reflecting the beast&rsquo;s symbolic character; medieval unicorns were, after all, supposedly lured into capture only by the exposed breasts of virgins. Also, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no denying the state of arousal evoked by its singular horn, <em>or </em>the ongoing fetishization of the unicorn in internet culture, if one cares to look for it. Monaghan&rsquo;s cushiony suggestion seems loyal to, even protective of, this erotic persona&mdash;keep it safe, keep it sexy.</p>
<p>The last sculpture in the show is a wall-mounted medallion emblazoned with the Starbucks logo, flipped upside down and painted black, with lustrous, carnal-looking faux fur protruding from it. To me it looks like a funky satanic inversion of the ubiquitous icon of commerce. If the <em>Unicorn in Bondage </em>is a gesture of protection, then perhaps this is one of refusal, a black-magic hex against the commercial degradation of our vital symbols. And a message to the disco beast, maybe, that it&rsquo;s time to retreat once more into the obscure forest, this time online, where it will hide but remain unassailably <em>real. </em></p>
