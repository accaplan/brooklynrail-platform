<p>It would be difficult to come up with a more oblivious statement than &ldquo;everything is okay.&rdquo; We can read it as either a provocation&mdash;an offensively false assertion&mdash;or an expression of denial. Antoine Catala&rsquo;s <em>Everything is Okay</em> should be understood to exemplify what Lauren Berlant calls a &ldquo;cruel optimism,&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;a condition of maintaining an attachment to a&hellip; problematic object,&rdquo; that &ldquo;provides &hellip; the continuity of the subject&rsquo;s sense of what it means to keep on living on and to look forward to being in the world.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> This process of self-delusion is communal; it requires a complex system of affective regulation. Networked communications technologies play a critical role in the maintenance of this system; social media is a regulator of our fears, hopes, and anxieties. The task of Antoine Catala&rsquo;s exhibition is to give form to this system of affective regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Flat Sitcom </em>(2017), we see two vertically mounted monitors&mdash;a familiar formal decision for those previously acquainted with Catala&rsquo;s work; the vertical orientation alludes to a smartphone, inviting yet refusing an active viewing experience. Two looping videos of clothed figures in upper middle class domestic settings&mdash;seated in a bathroom, leaning against a kitchen countertop&mdash;are placed in opposition. The people on the two monitors are almost static, but their appearance is glitched out&mdash;their eyelids, eyebrows, upper lips, hairlines, and various aspects of their clothing bulge, recede, and protrude over time. They text each other about a potentially threatening situation&mdash;someone heard a noise in the house&mdash;that alludes to crises in general. A dreamy synth-pop instrumental by Catala&rsquo;s friend, Olivier Alary, fills the room. The subtle distortion of the bodies renders them paralyzed. The sense of entrapment is unmistakeable; we are presented here with a model of regimented movement and expression in the form of digital stasis; the figures&rsquo; inability to move is paralleled by the texts&rsquo; inability to be wrong. Typos connote emotion; autocorrect snaps them back to a banal neutrality.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Throughout the gallery space are distributed small silicone objects&mdash;a t-shirt, a tote bag, a blouse, a sock&mdash;all titled <em>I am here for you</em>. Each object has a neutral-faced emoji bulging out of it. On the walls hang stretched latex canvases over extruded letterforms and shapes. One is a 3-D Band-Aid, the others read &ldquo;everything is okay&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Both the emoji-casts and the canvases are rigged to a pump system; the pieces periodically inflate and deflate. The emojis have dents that are buffed out and then re-inflicted, while the legibility of the canvas&rsquo; messages is contingent on their suffocation. We&rsquo;re presented here again with modes of regulation. Emojis function, as characterized by Hito Steyerl, as tokens of affective currency. Just as, according to credit theories of money, paper currency represents a unit of debt, emojis embody a debt of empathy. But as Steyerl goes on to note, following Brian Kuan Wood, an affective economy is an exhausted economy.<sup>2</sup> We are emotionally bankrupt. This is where Catala&rsquo;s language of injury plays in; these pieces are on life support&mdash;they&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which the canvases and floor sculptures are able to &ldquo;breathe&rdquo; has a centralized control mechanism; the entire show can be run by one computer via Wi-Fi. This detail points to how the system of affective regulation that we&rsquo;ve developed is irreconcilably centralized. In its most exaggerated form, this system takes the form of privatized, automated mental services such as the NHS-supported artificially intelligent psychiatric diagnostician <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/">Babylon</a> or Google&rsquo;s development of a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/learning-more-about-clinical-depression-phq-9-questionnaire/">PHQ-9 survey</a> that appears whenever someone searches for the term &ldquo;depression&rdquo; from their phone. These programs are the hubristic Band-Aid ever-present in Catala&rsquo;s work. They displace a holistic understanding of mental health and relegate the task of treating our collective melancholia to the same technocratic structures that produced and exploited our anxieties in the first place (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/09/facebooks-first-president-on-facebook-god-only-knows-what-its-doing-to-our-childrens-brains/?utm_term=.be18b0662517">Sean Parker&rsquo;s recent testimony regarding the underlying ethos of Facebook is relevant here</a>). Antoine Catala&rsquo;s <em>Everything is Okay</em> is a visualization of this hypocrisy; it points to a nefarious correspondence between a legible system of affective regulation and a centralization apparatus that seeks to unabashedly profit from our continued alienation.</p>
