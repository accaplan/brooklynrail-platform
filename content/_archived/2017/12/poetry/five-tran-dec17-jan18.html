<p><strong>HOW</strong> <strong>GOLD</strong> <strong>FLOATS</strong> <strong>ON</strong> <strong>WATER</strong></p>
<p>Tug on my strings. I can't reach them. Circuitry of subway systems &amp; homeland security etched into our thumbs. We gain access to rice smell fogging up shower tiles. We pick apart fruit. It&rsquo;s our favorite sport. Spring appears, bouncy on my mother's rings, sparkling as she manipulates the sweet flecks of citrus. Float into my mouth. If I hang a piece of lemon above your bed, would you thirst for it or let it dry?</p>

<p><strong>MIMUS</strong> <strong>POLYGLOTTOS</strong></p>
<p><em>To</em> <em>Kill</em> <em>a</em> <em>Mockingbird</em> was published in 1960, the year my mother was born. The 1960s&mdash;a time of heartbreak &amp; optimism, the headlines say. As a child, I would fall asleep staring into the open bedroom closet where my mother kept her books for ESL classes at the community college, <em>To</em> <em>Kill</em> <em>a</em> <em>Mockingbird</em> being one of those. I can still smell the brown leather backpack that held her books. In eighth grade we were assigned to read <em>To</em> <em>Kill</em> <em>A</em> <em>Mockingbird</em> &amp; I went back to my mother&rsquo;s closet to borrow hers. I wrote my name in permanent marker in a corner of the book cover, so as to claim it was mine. To protect the fact that I am my mother&rsquo;s&mdash;her only child&mdash;that I am the sole custodian of her narrative &amp; any threads that touch it. Responsible for carrying my mother&rsquo;s story in my body, I am an archive &amp; excavator, an act of preservation &amp; a pair of binoculars in a Ziploc bag. I fold in both of my first languages for my mother / my future daughter. Last night I stumbled upon a website with photos of confluences around the world, understanding where two bodies of water meet &amp; that eventually they do mix.</p>

<p><strong>SURVIVAL #</strong></p>
<p>Over breakfast I describe it to her as green glass hair</p>
<p>Which we braid at the bottom of the sea</p>
<p>In order to go there, first we gather tiny green apples</p>
<p>A necklace of dried lotus seeds around a new bride&rsquo;s neck</p>
<p>Eight cartfuls of longan &amp; lychee, unsweetened</p>
<p>An arm&rsquo;s length of pearl barley laid out on a cloth the width of this door we walked through</p>
<p>Five women carrying mung beans in their mouths</p>
<p>Crossing a sea of milk they fed to their children</p>
<p>Each bean softens with her migration through trauma</p>
<p>A handful of dried dates that have fallen from your eyelids</p>
<p>A swimming pool of snow fungus knotted up like a net</p>
<p>A hundred haircuts worth of kelp</p>
<p>My grandfather in his wheelchair eclipsed by a mountain of ginseng</p>
<p>Rock sugar melting gold across the grainy fields</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SURVIVAL #</strong></p>
<p>We have a long way to go</p>
<p>Learning to peel mangoes without fear</p>
<p>H&#7885;c &#259;n, h&#7885;c n&oacute;i</p>
<p>H&#7885;c g&oacute;i, h&#7885;c m&#7903;</p>
<p>How to eat, how to speak</p>
<p>How to close, how to open</p>
<p>Everything must be learned</p>
<p>I was scolded for incorrectly cutting a mooncake</p>
<p>Here are stems from which multiple leaves may flourish</p>
<p>Obtain seeds through normal channels</p>
<p>Pinch back the growing center</p>
<p>With regular care, it will grow</p>
<p>The thorns edging the leaves won't hurt you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SURVIVAL #</strong></p>
<p>I want to be soft when gently pressed between your thumb &amp; index finger</p>
<p>A generation eats salt</p>
<p>The future thirsts for water</p>
<p>A father feeds his daughter Costco meatballs in a paper bowl</p>
<p>Her mother splits open a rambutan with her teeth</p>
<p>We made rings out of longan seeds for our tiny fingers</p>
<p>With a shoestring we pulled a piece of bark, an immortal pet</p>
<p>We grow up being taught to eat outside of the box</p>
<p>Can you believe the only option for rice in California grocery stores for a while was Zatarains?</p>
<p>A trumpet for a sun</p>
<p>Certainty reincarnated as chicken hearts cooked in bitter greens</p>
<p>Supertop dining room</p>
<p>A man walks down the street at night pulling a cart of steamed peanuts</p>
<p>Drumming a chopstick on a metal lid of the pot</p>
<p>Striking midnight</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
