<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White House</strong></p>
<p align=right>Maybe I should have waited,<br>
  given my body more time &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 

<p>let the pearling of that new<br> 
Moon really settle in, burrow in
its call to me, but I had shit to do
and me to do and I forget 
the gall of the political --
how it begs against the centering
of self, begs you to meet 
your wrangled drama at the
door. I will always have
the trouble of dual simplicities;
of my need to do what I&#146;m
told and my need to do 
what I&rsquo;m led to. I didn&rsquo;t worry 
that it was too late, I didn&rsquo;t 
worry about you at all -- my body
a salt capsule to drown, little concern
for my pilot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=center>All I can do now is swim good<br>
good love, take note of the golds that 
work me down, the shifts that calm my cool. I&rsquo;m 
taking it East, steady on my slow
walk to the capital of my councils,
steady on the way to forgiving my fissures, counting
my crows. God knows I&rsquo;m a creature
of mystic, God knows I&rsquo;m a creature of critical
holes, I was given a life and led
it off and astray towards the glitter of 
direction. I know now what
thickened the breath, what blackened the
wound.</p> 
<p align=center>In the mirror I count the<br> 
new grids, the crimson lines of
life&rsquo;s torture coloring
the sugar of my thighs.</p> 
<p align=center>In addiction, the stakes are alive.</p>
<p align=center>In illness, the stakes -- they hide,<br>
they sputter, they die.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine??  My Sister an Astronaut?</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=right>When she was small I couldn&rsquo;t see<br> 
her I held her hand in tendered </p>

<p align=right>obligation fed her because <br>
she was hungry </p>

<p align=right>slapped her because <br>
she spoke one day she stole</p>

<p align=right>my underwear <br>
I climbed to the top of</p>

<p align=right>our bunk beds my waist a cradle over her&#146;s <br>
my fists a marsh of dead moons </p>

<p align=right>shadowing her little face <br>
after two taps I felt the </p>

<p align=right>monstrosity of my putrid desires <br>
flatten </p>

<p align=right>my intrinsic knowings <br>
suddenly afraid to bruise the small</p>

<p align=right>genius<br>
the strange foreign god of sisterhood</p>

<p align=right>it was then I knew <br>
I loved her something bad </p>

<p align=right>she&rsquo;s off to college going to study <br>
some aerospace biomedical nanoscience </p>

<p align=right>shit some shit only white people think <br>
to study because access is a frame</p>

<p align=right>of reference an organizing principle<br>
 in the family group chat she sweats us out</p>

<p align=right>with her excitement about next semester<br>
and 8 a.m trig</p>

<p>in High School I failed everything<br> 
graduated with underwhelming decimals</p> 

<p>the dark trauma of men lining my transcript<br> 
but baby girl has got something</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t<br> 
it&rsquo;s called discipline and</p>

<p>it moves her through the world slow<br>
and deliberate all the night a platform</p>

<p>all the trains just stations away<br>
she&rsquo;s off to space camp in a few weeks</p>

<p>and so fucking casual about it I say, hey<br>
maybe you should be an astronaut <em>yea, thinking</em></p>

<p><em>about it</em> as if a breakfast burrito or<br>
mommy&rsquo;s oxtail</p> 

<p align=right>my girl my young knight<br>
driving a needle through the inflated</p>

<p align=right>boundaries of ambiguous sciences I think<br>
<em>shiiiiiiit imagine?? My sister an astronaut???</em></p>

<p align=right>lineage narrativized through the brat<br>
of my heart into</p>

<p align=right>the prodigious stuff of the stars<br>
towering in bigness</p>

<p align=right>bigger than you and you and you<br>
and you and you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When I Say The Hood Made Me, I Mean:</strong></p>

<p>A sheer violence and a bed embalmed in it, a small girl pretzel legged at the center, soft stones placed at the north and west of her frame, crystals stapled at the southernmost point, the new world a salt capsule, a one way entrance. Before her nana died there was a brief quiet and then the spirits came and she was besieged with rupture, and talked with them only through series&rsquo; of bloodlettings,</p> 

<p>the blade cold against the stiff brown skin, the dare ripe with noise, so much noise, and is anyone listening (except the pores of these walls) to this girl shrugging out of the mud, sopping with it but limbs activated nevertheless and the stones with a tide of tension below pushing them up up until the spirit exhausts and the crystals fall back into the bowl of the bed, the sugar sticky and stark, a soft voice initiates the beginning of a new life</p> 

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a hum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
