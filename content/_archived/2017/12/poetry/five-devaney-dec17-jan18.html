<p><strong>Brilliant Corners</strong><br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Jennie C. Jones </em></p>
<p>The magic parts before they were burned-up and vacuumed.</p>
<p>A sound so light as if no one was there at all.</p>
<p>Your body a buffer between <em>the same word said at the same time,</em> and other hyper jinx chances.</p>
<p>The dust-up made the light look more gray than green.</p>
<p>Time was opened-up wider then, <em>so wide </em>in fact that even now it isn&rsquo;t all the way shut.</p>
<p>Horns, sirens, and acoustic panels. Plenty of Three People Can Keep a Secret, if Two Are Dead Stories to go around.</p>
<p>A late and great string quartet playing in the next room.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell where the music was coming from, and I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I was back in high school practicing a clarinet concerto.</p>
<p>And for months, upended by the harp on the headphones in the Chopin waltz.</p>
<p>Walkman freewheeling Sony Walkman&mdash;</p>
<p>And only one other person in the world.</p>
<p align=right>It does not matter where we fell in, we did.</p>
<p>What they called AC/DC I called AC/DC. Though Monk wasn&rsquo;t Monk, he was MONK: avuncular, like an uncle with no glass in his glasses, poking his fingers <em>in</em> to show us.</p>
<p>Not silence, but the stillness of the world; and yet even being still didn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t scratch your nose.</p>
<p>How once you heard the sound of water running under a heavy manhole cover. The Great Spirit echoing in the old city pipes; the ghost river running under Allegheny Avenue.</p>
<p>Not sound, but the fact of sound.</p>
<p>Not sound or the fact of sound, but the fact of sound after the sound was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hell-Dusted Blue Jeans</strong></p>
<p>The Great Plains were over filled with blue jeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the war, the sky was filled with blue jeans.</p>
<p><em>Was I making up this story? </em>some voice wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The corners of the mouth. In high school I worked at the Gap</p>
<p>selling jeans, corduroys, Mountain Dew. Provisions of nourishment.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Mass Effect </em>video games had colonized my</p>
<p>central nervous system. &nbsp;A frame without a mirror to tell</p>
<p>my fate, I continued a hum along.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Great Depression,</p>
<p>each person blaming him or herself for their own ruin.</p>
<p>The stories are all there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cold Fingers Light the Way</strong></p> 
<p>I read Bill&rsquo;s essay on Ray, it was 100% Bill / 100% Ray.<br> 
<em>Walked in the rain and got very soaked. </em>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The old photocopy had surfaced from a personal slush pile 
in the dark lake of the TV room where I had been hiding. 	
If anyone asked, I would have said I had been <em>following the news.</em> 
But it was more than that. I was consumed. I put my stamp on that. </p> 
<p>For much of Bill&rsquo;s life he had been in the New York Correspondence School:<br> 
envelopes, photocopied GUM BALLS For Sale, and at least one secret love. </p>
<p><em>I will incorporate the letters that seem appropriate in this letter which will be <br>
waiting for you when you return&mdash;</em></p>
<p>To the end he had a full head of white hair, stood 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; in his stocking feet.<br>
And sharp words for Chelsea and all else that had gone &ldquo;berserk.&rdquo;</p> 	
<p>&ldquo;Scratches show the surface as the surface,&rdquo; more notes scribbled down. Elsewhere <em>looking at the views as if I were seeing the feeling I longed to see and to feel.</em><br> 
A turn and a half-dozen more&mdash;Bill&rsquo;s limpid prompt to his correspondent 
to find the courage to their own tenderness.</p>
<p>Envelope as a vehicle of its own. Another printed in Sharpie to WILIAM S. WILSON from RAY JOHNSON. Direct about their indirections and home.</p> 
<p>The letters of each name, a plot as much as they are <em>instruction for those who would bury the dead</em>. Speaking in sweeping monologues to all of the living-room shades. King Lear of the Chesapeake, standing and gesturing in my mind, and signing-off in an email: &ldquo;I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats. If it be man&rsquo;s work, I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Memory Corkscrews So You Can&rsquo;t Remember It</strong></p> 

<p>I make my prayers in another part of the city,<br>
but they keep blowing back. 
At the end of the year something 
called Sneaker Day,
Swedish Fish and tail pipes in the breeze.  
Two kids jamming 300 Styrofoam cups into 
a chain-link fence, spelling-out R U N right along
the green way.</p> 

<p>Too young to drive, but opinions carried weight.<br> 
The first day of the Cadillac, that first week, 
the whole summer, brilliant sunbeads after the rain: 
the two-toned Charcoal Caddie. 
Jerry Vale came in to get his haircut.</p>

<p>And did they still wear the ponytail style?</p>

<p>Eventually there was a car, a hobbled Pinto,<br> 
cheap and easy to park. Driving circles 
around one another,  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you can run yourself over.
Eating lunch, C said she wouldn&rsquo;t say things 
like that, but she wasn&rsquo;t telling me not to, 
but maybe don&rsquo;t. I had pizza and a lemonade. 

<p>All rumors reset in a blaze, prophecies<br> 
of another space and age.</p>  

<p>Did the Night Shift and Day Shift ever speak<br> 
to each other again?</p> 

<p>The year with little talking, but music<br>
coming from the blue car booming inside out&mdash;
all the live long day; a pulse more than a sound.
There would be no outside then. 
Even the river ran more quietly, the FM radio 
streaming more smoothly over the stream. </p>

<p>You almost had to get your ear wet to hear. <br>
Warmly and firmly it said <em>Get out. And don&rsquo;t 
you ever come back here again. </em>
How many Mars miles ago was that? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Most of Tomorrow </strong></p>
<p>No socks, no Bill, my glasses,</p>
<p>and old No. 2. For the past two weeks on every list</p>
<p>I had his name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be around most of tomorrow,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill said. And the rest of the time, where? No. 2</p>
<p>added a word or two: annual blood test, <em>sibling made </em></p>
<p><em>close and breathing throughout</em>, wish I could eavesdrop,</p>
<p>a line disappearing from his mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a title, a tune:</p>
<p>Saturday Night. Moon People. Goods and Services.</p>
<p>Repeat after Me. Expect Delays. Portrait and Dream.</p>
<p>Dear Bill. I have a picture of your note in your hand,</p>
<p>it was bruised all over. There&rsquo;s no concealing a hand.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know about that</em>, I can hear him say:</p>
<p><em>Oh yes you can, oh boy I do</em>, in rich middle tones.</p>
<p>A profile in exile, view over the bay at Cassis.</p>
<p>His friend the journalist from Burgundy, and the cold white</p>
<p>of the white still gives a chill.</p>
<p>Found it back in New Jersey for $120 and considered it.</p>
<p>Now most of tomorrow has been gone for days, yet</p>
<p>the part that was away from the start is still here,</p>
<p>first-hand and near: &ldquo;Back around 9.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Nine. Nine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine will be fine. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
