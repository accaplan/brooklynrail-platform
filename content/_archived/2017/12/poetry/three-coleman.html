<p><strong>roses from Ethiopia</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A thorny equinox and I&rsquo;ve been serially <em>felled</em>&mdash;<br>
once because of animal husbandry, again because tired and sagg&egrave;d 
withal while shopping for carbonic roses as a cure-all. </p>

<p>We the people let&rsquo;s not asphyxiate in a cocoon of doom, our union<br>
 a bursting chrysalis of trauma minus butterflies.</p>

<p>In holy moods near the bacon section all about martyrdom I&rsquo;m<br>
distracted by a Ganymede courting ground beef. Spying the 
contents of his basket, I try to detect if he is taken. (I imagine his 
robust blood, his man at home, their holidays near water.) </p>

<p>So many times I&rsquo;ve held my breath today: covering nose and mouth<br>
with my shirt. The usual sensory impasse emergency! </p>

<p>On Houston Street a million-wheel truck chugs past churning<br>
everything up for me to inhale. A purple band-aid on my ankle
covers a portal for bacteria. It took three or four days of self-
ministration &rsquo;til the acv cured maybe-MRSA idk. </p>

<p>I get acupuncture. The clinic door is open to the Superfund traffic<br>
bad vibes cig-bog o&rsquo; Greenpoint. When I ask if I can close
the door, I&rsquo;m showing them their oversight.</p>

<p>Finally she sees me she takes my pulse she reads my lingua she<br>
gives me thirteen needles, one atop my head for dumniss. </p>

<p>My bane seeping out of each exit I&rsquo;m off-gassing in gradual bliss.<br>
Pressure hovers: that feeling of pre-touch an itch of contact is
extrasensory spread&amp;release. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m semi-waiting for the wound to close, for the angelic body to<br>
exhale meta-bodies to scatter and uncluster flocks of priceless
birds</p>

<p>past the celestial equator<br> 
dispersing mid-air </p>

<p>I secede &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;oh look<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;oh look
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh look!</p>

<p><strong>three mornings</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (via Philip Whalen)</p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I wake up | big whoop<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s 7:27am, solar. I put on a bathing suit.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why not. A little fun
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before the slog. No one
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has to know.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My autonomy swims with itself&#151;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m taking in the scenery,
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;praying to the pine cone
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rainbow prism crystal, the mystics,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lone dog peony heavy
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with longing
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can tell this day&rsquo;s amenable
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to leisurely religion,
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the kind that makes
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for a good time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>	

<p>The messenger cuddles too close to Chiron<br>
an immunosuppressive empath who won&rsquo;t stop talking </p>

<p>I have been offered solicitude from an airplane<br> 
in advance of tomorrow&mdash;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis true that the present feels quaint<br>
such crudity and veneration of crisis: it&rsquo;s so medieval</p> 

<p>Midsummer arose to an adoring audience of barefoot teens<br> 
in California who never said it was time for anything, just whatever</p>

<p>Now&rsquo;s olden cold treacle in bone china on the Eastern Seaboard,<br>
brushing my teeth with German salt-paste as a bourgeois experiment</p>

<p>Fantasizing the life of a sculptor<br>
what is this, the Marble Faun</p>

<p>Reading postcards from those cheap rent poet-monks of yore<br> 
floating on noodles in chlorine in deathless non-heaven</p>

<p>How many baptisms did they need<br>
their trials by fire are finally smoke</p>

<p>Get me a switch! plurality is loves not love<br>
try some (or several) and write me back!</p> 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>	

<p>Not to be lofty, but I&rsquo;m done with Ceres on my wall.<br> 
Galatea in ivory can stay but I seek other iterations, 
GIANTS, for instance! nice ones!</p> 

<p>A clay cave behind my bedroom lit from within by embers<br> 
was deserted in haste by conjurers the soft silt still holds their tread</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if I could hug that history I would, and quick</p>

<p>You can forge a spelling with nothing&mdash;heaving ballast in a stutter&mdash;<br> 
I&rsquo;ve done it, and carried a tiny pebble under my tongue to slake thirst in
pretend emergencies, my reptilian afternoon hours supervised by stoners</p>

<p>if they weren't teaching us how to survive they were enticing us<br> 
to be reborn, a heavy trip for sure</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; birds chirrup tra la / rise and shine it&rsquo;s a new day</p>

<p>I watered a lemon tree in Central Park<br>
an olive grove in grody Bushwick
people loved each other comfortably in public</p>

<p>(in fact, none of that<br> 
has happened yet)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am texting a Severe Alert in stone: <em>good morn</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put the stone in a bottle a sea salutation<br>
thrown the bottle in the bathy water 
full of baby whales</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s no joke about the giants<br>
they&rsquo;re here on the ark</p> 

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and we wait for breakfast to drop from the sky</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
