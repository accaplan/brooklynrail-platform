<p>We called Tim our soul brother. I often told him that he was an Evangelist of Art. That simply meant that he went around the world speaking to diverse audiences about the impact of Great Art and how he witnessed this Great Art transform lives of inner city kids from the South Bronx. He was powerful in his delivery fully ignited with the passion and fire of any preacher I have ever heard. That same passion and fire was presented every single time he sang a note with our choir. Tim Rollins we speak your name. You belong to the ages!&nbsp;</p>
