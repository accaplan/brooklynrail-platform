<p>I knew Tim as far back as early &rsquo;80s during the storefront days of Group Material. Tim was a real enthusiast, one of the most positive people I have ever known. He believed in the power of Art, artists, education and activism. Tim kept the faith with his unflagging support and love for artists of all ages. He loved to talk about painting. Years ago, when he was looking for a congregation to call his home, we went to the Abyssinian Baptist Church together. When the choir began to sing, Tim leapt to his feet, hands clapping, body moving, and singing in a big, booming voice. He was truly blessed, as am I to have known him and been his friend.</p>
