<p>Tim introduced himself to me in 1979 at my exhibition MATERIAL at Ronald Feldman Gallery. He and Julie Ault, Yolanda Hawkins, and Marybeth Nelson all looked about twelve years old. Tim said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read everything you&rsquo;ve ever written Conrad.&rdquo; He had also read everything many other contemporary artists had written as well as educationists. He was extremely well read and extremely enthusiastic. I knew from that moment he would achieve great things&hellip;.and he did.</p>
