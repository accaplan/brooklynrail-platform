<p>I visited Tim &amp; K.O.S. back in the early &rsquo;90s then in my early &rsquo;20s.&nbsp;As someone mentioned to me at the Homegoing Service for Tim, doing&nbsp;<em>Group</em>&nbsp;was always Tim&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Material</em>,&nbsp;it has also radically changed the way I&nbsp;understand artistic and curating&mdash;his generosity, this collective effort, is more important than ever.</p>
<p>May you have found in your new home the freedom that you so longed and fought for.</p>
