title: Shadow Behind Eclipsefor John Ashbery

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he died, a temperature went down<br>
Trees in the sky above Flatirons, tremor there
Oh didn&rsquo;t, then did&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See?
We were driving in the canyon moons ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when he had said then &ldquo;closing in&rdquo;
Fool for this love
He was our drumming ritual if you were a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a berserker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and willed by constellations
He was our prize for being born
This world through school time, through bliss
through saltiness in the question
<em>Can gentlemen do without?</em>
Never retreat from scrutiny
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or miss the enemy, burnt leaf smell like resin
He was our fear of a sentence half-dreamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if we couldn't seize the whole
He was our vessel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cave and boot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;train ride to the province
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meandering by river
Panic to be left out of this
Landscape, a picnic
Whole tome memorized, many colors
He was our vanguard of non-self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; scent and doubt
Of deep carriage into the unknown
What do you know of it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you know him not?
When he did laugh he did and muse
That was a blue eye special
He was putting things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next to one another
&nbsp;&nbsp; you too somehow included
They you it -- things -- didn't have to bond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but in poetry happen
And now listen to his voice with
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;eyes gone wild for flowers
Scratchy reel to reel, 1966
Sacred fury of a primordial world
Half mannish garb on the sentence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a profile in the hallway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across all crystal neuro pathways
Mirror, mirror?
Up to nature and we had a glimpse
He was our respite,
Midnight excursions off limits
Sometimes a candle at the brain wondering &ldquo;fallen star&rdquo;
What rhymed with it?
&ldquo;Espoir&rdquo;, hope?
Blood heart, held supine
He was our cosmography in a better world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you could count on, relief, release</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
