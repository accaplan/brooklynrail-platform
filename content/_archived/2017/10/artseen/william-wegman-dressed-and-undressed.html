<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what happens when you dress up a dog. Put a blonde wig on a Weimaraner. Give it a top hat, dress it in elegant furs or a Hawaiian shirt, step back for a moment, and take a look. You won&rsquo;t end up with anything quite as good as a photograph by William Wegman, who is a master of printing and composition, but inevitably your gag, at least in purpose, will approximate his art. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so compelling about Wegman, who has gotten as close as anyone to finding ingenuity in a commonplace joke. His photographs are full of visual tricks, verbal puns, and references to art history, but they never present an irresolvable riddle. It&rsquo;s the utter transparency of his art that defines his intelligence.</p>	!!img2!!
<p>It is easy to be complicated. Simplicity, directness, clarity of purpose&mdash;these are the rare qualities in an artist, and Wegman has them in deep measure. <em>Dressed and Undressed</em>, his recent exhibition at Sperone Westwater, proves this point. The show of large-format (twenty by twenty-four inch) Polaroid pictures, taken between 1979 and 2007, is abundant in the cleverness of its humble means. There is a picture of a Weimaraner wearing a quizzical expression and a sock on its snout; it is titled <em>Proboscidea </em>(1993) after the taxonomic order that elephants (and all their extinct relatives) are classified under. Another picture, <em>Bus Stop </em>(1990), has a grey dog in a perfectly matching grey coat. Here is a weary commuter grown tired of waiting. Few of the photographs are especially elaborate because Wegman does not need much to get his point across.</p>
<p>Wegman&rsquo;s dogs play many roles, but they always wear a look of slight confusion, as if they aren&rsquo;t quite sure how they got involved in this charade. The artist often speaks of them as his collaborators: &ldquo;My dogs are working dogs and working dogs need to work and feel part of your life.&rdquo; But part of the conceit of his work is that the Weimaraners don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re wearing shoes or socks. They are always in on the game, always happy to please&mdash;in <em>Twisted Hope </em>(2001), a Weimaraner wears a chic turtleneck dress and the aloof look of a self-aware model&mdash;nevertheless, there is a real detachment between us and them, which is the gap from which Wegman&rsquo;s great humor springs.</p>!!img3!!	
<p>Sperone Westwater is relatively modest. It offers only a small selection of the hundreds of Polaroids Wegman took between 1979 and 2007, when the company stopped producing large-format film (a new book from Thames &amp; Hudson, titled <em>William Wegman: Being Human</em>, affords a larger view, with more than 300 pictures). But the exhibition traces an important turning point in Wegman&rsquo;s career. When he began taking these pictures, it was after a year-long break from working with his first dog, Man Ray. That year Man Ray &ldquo;would come into my studio and slump down and realize I was just making drawings or little paintings or taking photographs not of him, and I&rsquo;ll never forget the deep sighs he had like, &lsquo;Oh god, another day of not doing anything, with me just being a dog, sleeping here at his feet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sweet story, made sweeter by how busy all the dogs are in <em>Dressed and Undressed</em>. Nowadays, they&rsquo;re always in the middle of some strange scenario, like the poor sap <em>Daisy Nut Cake </em>(1994) covered in fruit and flowers like a Giuseppe Arcimboldo painting. But backstories are just the sugar on top of Wegman&rsquo;s work, which requires no preparation. How rare that elusive quality in contemporary art: pure lucidity.</p>
