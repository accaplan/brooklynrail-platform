  An Excerpt from Slow Writing: Thom Andersen on Cinema  With an introduction by
  Mark Webber 
---

!!img1!!<p><em>Slow Writing: Thom Andersen on Cinema</em> is the first collection of writings by a filmmaker who is known and much respected for his celebrated documentary essays including <em>Red Hollywood </em>(1996, made with No&euml;l Burch), <em>Los Angeles Plays Itself</em> (2003), and <em>The Thoughts That Once We Had</em> (2015). The book gathers together texts written since 1966; some unpublished and others that have previously appeared in magazines such as <em>Artforum</em>, <em>Film Comment</em>, and <em>Cinema Scope</em>. Its range of subjects encompasses the avant-garde, documentary, installations, exploitation films, film noir, independent features, and Hollywood productions, and Andersen&rsquo;s plainspoken writing style communicates an enthusiasm and knowledge nourished through many years of watching, discussing and teaching cinema.</p>
<p>Amongst a number of texts relating to screenings organized by Andersen himself is the most curious piece in the book&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Wrong with this Picture? Almost Everything&rdquo;&mdash;written during his tenure as programmer at Media Study/Buffalo. It was published in the independent student newspaper <em>The Spectrum</em> in February 1978. The occasion was a projection of<em> The Desert People</em>, a 1974 film by Argentinian artist David Lamelas, which was shown together with George Kuchar&rsquo;s gonzo screen test pastiche<em> I, An Actress</em>, Werner Herzog&rsquo;s spoof documentary <em>Precautions Against Fanatics</em>, and <em>Accident</em>, a National Film Board of Canada production by Martin Duckworth and Patrick A. Crawley that documents the latter&rsquo;s altered worldview following his survival of an otherwise fatal light aircraft crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article was ostensibly an independent preview, and was attributed to the name of a 19th century fictional character. It&rsquo;s a fake review of a fictional documentary, somewhat perversely written in a sarcastic tone that is highly critical of a film that Andersen in fact admires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the new book&rsquo;s lengthy introduction, &ldquo;Why I Did Not Become a Film Critic,&rdquo; the author offers an explanation:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occasionally I did feel like writing something about one of our shows&mdash;program notes that were sometimes written afterward and never published. I wrote for myself, in a style that would now be called &lsquo;snarky.&rsquo; Maybe the words came easy for once; all I had to do was take dictation from my unconscious. I did manage to get a review of <em>The Desert People</em> by David Lamelas published in the student newspaper at SUNY Buffalo, despite an evident conflict of interest. I took advantage of the connections some students in the university film society had with the newspaper, and of course I used a pseudonym. My namesake, Aurora Floyd, was the protagonist and ostensible author of a middling Victorian novel. Although I loved <em>The Desert People</em> and I wanted to write about it, I thought a positive review was not appropriate, given the conflict of interest, and a seemingly hostile review might attract more students to the show. It didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Mark Webber</p>
<p>As a Jesus-fried guru of ontological-hysteric cinema, George Landow once asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?&rdquo; Almost everything, in the case of <em>The Desert People</em>, a movie which will have its first&mdash;and probably last&mdash;Buffalo showing tonight at 8 p.m. at the Waterfront Community Center, 95 4th St., Buffalo, as part of a documentary film series sponsored by Media Study/Buffalo.</p>
<p>A frisson-inducing first impression is left by a rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll muzak score so insipid it might have been composed by Mike Curb after an overdose of Elavil. This to accompany a series of highway tracking shots that stare over-insistently on the model name of the car the five main characters are riding in (Gran Torino) or lose sight of the car entirely and end up strobing over a broken white line. Against these charming distractions appear the titles superimposed in the manner of late Roger Corman or the Universal optical department in the days when every picture from that benighted studio looked like every other.</p>
<p>What follows this mindless credit sequence is nothing less than a biker movie about intellectuals&mdash;a genre with neither a past nor a future. Most of the film&rsquo;s fifty or so minutes are occupied by five long monologues delivered by five mid-twentyish city-billies who have apparently just travelled together to the Papago Indian reservation in Southern Arizona where they spent five weeks. These monologues are punctuated by more highway shots, more benumbing rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, and brief sequences of desultory conversation among the five as they ride in their white Torino through those peculiar Southern Californian landscapes which seem to promise a murdered husband in every yucca-covered culvert.</p>
<p>During the monologues, the camera always manages to station itself too close or too far away from the speakers, and they are forced to unburden themselves of their experiences with the Indians in incomprehensibly distracting&mdash;or, at best, irrelevant&mdash;settings that could have suggested themselves as appropriate only to the most psychotic location scout. The first desert person to make his appearance, a scholarly sort who might be a fledged anthropologist, is filmed while he stands on the sidewalk abutting a commercial district street that might belong to a small town as easily as to the semi-urban shopping-center extensions of a metropolis. His attempt to relate what he has learned of Papago culture is compromised by several embarrassing revelations&mdash;he is finally led by the momentum of his words to confess that the Indians wouldn&rsquo;t tell him any of their legends because he missed the folklore season.</p>
<p>The scene drifts to one of those sandstone and Plexiglas <em>restauranterias</em> which represent California&rsquo;s most archetypal contribution to Western civilization and are now beyond the farthest reaches of descriptive prose. Here we meet the first of the two female people who sojourned with the Papagos, a pristined beauty with straight center-parted blonde hair and turquoise bracelet, nursing a cup of coffee in a back booth. A middle-class existentialist, she could pass as a Godard heroine whose brain had been rotted by too much transcendental meditation. But however profound her reticence, she is continuously upstaged by the insidious rapport between the green vinyl upholstery of this anomieous coffee shop and the reversal color stock, which is imbued with a fateful predilection for the rancid end of the spectrum. But she is treated with more sympathy than the other woman in the film&mdash;a journalist from an East Coast feminist mag, who must deliver her monologue in a composition dominated entirely by the foreshortened hood of her rented Chrysler. A composition perhaps appropriate for an old-fashioned macho automobile commercial, hardly so for a discourse on feminist consciousness among Papago women.</p>
<p>And the fourth speaker is placed in front of what appears to be a large hotel. Yellow taxis load and unload in the background, and a figure in an incongruous grenadier&rsquo;s uniform complete with plumed hat keeps this traffic moving with over-expansive arm gestures. Finally we meet the fifth traveller, himself a Papago Indian now living away from the reservation, who served as guide to the others. He speaks of the necessity and difficulty of preserving the Papago culture, first in English, then in Spanish, and finally in the language of the Papagos. This soliloquy is characterized in the publicity handout as &ldquo;very moving and emotional.&rdquo; Perhaps, if you understand the Papago dialect. As he speaks, he is standing in what appears to be a sand-barren desert with perhaps a dry lake as a boundary&mdash;but why is that lifeguard tower lurking over there in distance?</p>
<p>I have been asked not to reveal the ending of the film, so I will only say that it is, indeed, schematic enough to be ruined by the telling. And I will add that the special form of oblivion reserved for desert people is so appropriately off the wall that this ruination would be a loss.</p>
<p>The perpetuator of this devious violation of cinematic proprieties is David Lamelas, who according to the sparse information made available by Media Study/Buffalo, is an Argentinian artist who has emigrated to the land of the lotus eaters and bitten the hand that soothes him. His talent is negligible. With <em>The Desert People</em> he has realized the movie Tom Laughlin might have given us were he a punk rocker instead of a billy-come-lately hippy. And not even Michelangelo (Antonioni) has captured so astutely as David the special banality of the Southern California landscape, which here appears as a single superhighway in search of some place (any place) to go.</p>
<p>Rounding out the program at the Waterfront Center are three one- or two-reelers which pose equally vexing questions about the intimacy between film and reality: <em>I, An Actress</em> by George Kuchar, the founder of the lumpen Hollywood sensibility which John Waters has made commercially viable; <em>Accident</em> from the National Film Board of Canada, a quite chilling reconstruction of a glider plane crash; and Werner Herzog&rsquo;s <em>Precautions Against Fanatics</em>, which got the benefit of the doubt from me just for its title. I understand it was made by the same Werner Herzog who directed such worthy films as <em>Aguirre, the Wrath of God,</em> and <em>Stroszek</em> (which will be unspooled later this term in the Squire Conference Theatre). This is an &ldquo;early work,&rdquo; but had Herzog produced nothing else, his place in the history of the practical joke&mdash;if not the cinema&mdash;would be assured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, these movies make up a program that can be recommended to lovers of the eccentric, if to no one else. At the least, they demonstrate that oddball sorts can make films for less serious purposes than the solicitation of compassion for victims of UFO sightings. &nbsp;<em><br /> &mdash;Aurora Floyd, 1978</em></p>
