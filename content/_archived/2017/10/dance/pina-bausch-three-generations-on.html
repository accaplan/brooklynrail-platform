title: 'EDITOR''S NOTE Pina Bausch: Three Generations On'
---

<p>Pina Bausch&rsquo;s dance-theater has left an indelible mark on Brooklyn (and the world), captivating and confronting audiences, dancers, and choreographers since Tanztheater Wuppertal&rsquo;s BAM premiere in 1984. The return to BAM of the iconic double-bill <em>Caf&eacute; M&uuml;ller </em>and <em>The Rite of Spring </em>this past month reminded us of Bausch&rsquo;s enduring power&mdash;to haunt, to dazzle&mdash;across time. In recognition of her abiding impact and influence, the <em>Rail </em>&rsquo;s coverage is situated in three generational vantage points on Bausch&rsquo;s career and legacy. </p> <p>The <em>Rail </em>is honored to have dance critic doyenne Deborah Jowitt bringing to bear the long view of the Tanztheater Wuppertal&rsquo;s lasting sway over the dance world; she is one of the very few who can. Deborah is joined by the dance scholar Clare Croft, and by <em>Rail </em>contributing writer Sariel Frankfurter.</p>
