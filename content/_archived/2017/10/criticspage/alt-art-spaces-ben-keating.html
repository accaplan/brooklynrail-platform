<p>All we do is look<br>Down<br>any more<br>We need to look<br>Up</p>
<p>What sets an arts space apart is its ability to be a part of art embracing process in front and behind the event of art making.</p>
<p>A museum is the life and ecosystem of creativity, providing an estuary for artist to habitat, it&rsquo;s this brackish ground between museums and studio, dance or foundry, intimate gallery or grand space&mdash;the ability to embrace everything in between.</p>
