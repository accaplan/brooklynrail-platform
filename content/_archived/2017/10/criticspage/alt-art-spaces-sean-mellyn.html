<p> My whole career as an artist in New York has been annually running away from impending gentrification. Like every other artist in New York, I have had an amazing studio for a period of time, then the building gets sold, the rent goes through the roof, the neighborhood gets re-branded, blah, blah, blah. I am, in part, the cause of my own demise. I&rsquo;ve had studios in Long Island City, the Lower East Side, and DUMBO. All three neighborhoods are now bastions of luxury condos with dazed nannies/tourists stumbling towards their next foamy caffeine fix. One could say this about half a dozen or more neighborhoods in New York. I think all New Yorkers have construction fatigue at this point&mdash;it feels as though we have been in a war, and we have. The developers won. But New York has always been ever changing. Something new, some new model, or a new way for artists to work will come along. I see nontraditional institutions as one of the few smart solutions to this very urban dilemma.</p>
<p >I like leaving my apartment in Chinatown (where a ninety-story residential tower is being built next door to me) and take the Path train to Mana. I like that it&rsquo;s 19th century life as a tobacco factory now has 21st-century steel studio doors instead of stainless steel appliances. I see Mana as an evolving space, a mammoth complex that can accommodate and absorb a multitude of situations, exhibitions, and installations at any given time. It may be part of a new model for art-making in urban environments&mdash;creative hives buzzing with ambitious energy.</p>
