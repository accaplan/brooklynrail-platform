<p> Adi, Ange, Gabi: We moved our studio to Mana Contemporary four months ago after eighteen years in Chinatown&hellip;Whaaao&hellip;..so much space and opportunity for threeASFOUR &hellip;. It was difficult at first, but surprised how fast we got used to the commute. We looove the opposite rush hour Path train, a quiet / peaceful experience and faster than taking the train to Brooklyn&hellip;not to mention the charrrming walk back and forth through Little India / Jersey City&hellip;Mana feels like an Art Castle in the middle of a European countryside, filled with a varied array of artists (400+)&mdash;commercial, established, young, old, famous, unknown&mdash;it is such a pleasure to be in a place that welcomes all kinds of creative minds&hellip;</p>
