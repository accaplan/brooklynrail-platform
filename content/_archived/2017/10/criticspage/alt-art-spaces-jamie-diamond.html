<p>In 2014, I was invited by Ysa Pinyol and Karline Moeller to participate in the first iteration of the Mana residency program.</p>
<p>As an institution, Mana believes in the power of art to inspire and is filled with wonder and possibility. During the last four years, I&rsquo;ve seen major transformations, ambition, and potential.</p>
<p>Fostering a dynamic environment of inclusion and solidarity, an open intellectual framework with strong opportunity for collaboration and dialogue exists&mdash;though there are divergent practices among artists.</p>
<p>The founding vision of the space is inspiring and infectious. The commitment and belief in the arts as a vehicle to inform and change is palpable, and its result is an environment where the possibilities of artmaking are legion. It continues to forge a strong sense of community where artists can thrive.</p>
<p>At a time of great uncertainty and political strife, knowing that institutions exist that persevere and continue to grow provides me with a sense of comfort and optimism.</p>
<p>Great things happen in dark times. We need supportive art institutions now more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
