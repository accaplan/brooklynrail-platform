<p><strong>Witnessed in the Convex Mirror: Vision</strong><p>
<p>In the climate of sighs flung across our world<br>a cloth over a birdcage may be premature<br>Better to stuff afternoons with muscular horses<br>galloping at paces as easy as sunlight. An<br>education also surfaces with the scent of<br>grass: it&rsquo;s most pleasing when freshly-cut, thus<br>revealing something about the effect of time<br>as dilution, and how suffering might be borne<br> willingly, if not welcomed. When the path of<br> grass-cutting blades interrupt the somnolence<br> of ducks, enjoy glimpses into someone&rsquo;s Heaven<br>with the sheen of rainbow-colored jewels revealed<br> by opened wings as they take flight, perhaps<br>an experience to encourage: as regards doom<br>do believe alternatives exist if one opts for sight</p>

<p><strong>Witnessed in the Convex Mirror: 1.6 x 10^-35 Meters</strong></p>
<p>To siphon off the life of the studio, deflate<br>its mapped space to enactments, island it&mdash; <br>so the artist concluded after a prolonged<br> analysis through a microscope. Yet<br> it was not the microscopic focus that<br>flared &ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; over her head capped<br>by hair flattened from the oily sweat of her<br> toil. Light flared after she pulled back<br> from peering at nano viruses, rolled her<br> head to ease the tightness of her neck<br>and caught her reflection on a wall mirror<br> to conclude, &ldquo;This is not the life I dreamt <br>of when I was a girl tickling the whiskers<br> of catfish after waters receded in the<br>Mississippi.&rdquo; Thus, she went fishing<br>As she sat on the riverbank waiting for<br>a tug on her line, she anticipated her<br>future paintings to be the opposite of<br>realism. Later, while fish fried over<br>her campsite fire, she meticulously<br>put small bullets of paint upon the top<br>edge of a small canvas propped up<br>on a portable easel. As she ate her fish<br>simply fried with olive oil, sliced onions<br>salt and pepper, she watched gravity<br>elongate the paint balls down into<br>lines of fragmented marks on canvas<br>She was moved to transcend color<br>to recall white pages on red scrolls: <br><em>Hello Bai Ju Yi, Du Fu, Fang Zhong<br>Yan, He Zhi, Li Bai, Su Shi, Qang Lin<br>Yong Wan Li, Zhao Yi, Zhu Ge Liang</em><br>The artist nodded at her conclusion as<br>she savored her meal, thinking of<br>the &ldquo;Planck length&mdash;&rdquo; the line before<br>things cease becoming measurable<br>In such a space, she thinks, <em>Poetry</em><br>becomes the logical conclusion&mdash; <br>considering her meal, she also thought<br>the fish&rsquo;s legacy would have benefited<br>from thyme. In her future, she would<br>stumble across a Food Network<br>recipe positing, &ldquo;For catfish, there<br>can never be too much thyme.&rdquo;<br>

<p><strong>Witnessed in the Convex Mirror: Aura</strong></p>
<p>But as the principle of each individual thing is<br>hostile to, exists at the expense of all the others<br>we find it difficult to write a new poem after<br>inscribing the calendar with &ldquo;FRIDAY, 8 a.m.&mdash; <br>Pump out the septic tank.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t want to<br>open the window overlooking beds of roses<br>and sniff sewage. But neither did we want to<br>write a poem compelling you to wrinkle your nose<br>because to be human is to poop. It was by trying<br>to avoid this poem that my research led me<br> to discover a type of epileptic seizure&mdash;called<br>&ldquo;Aura,&rdquo; it begins with the scent of rotten eggs<br>Ah: so swiftly does the moon slip behind a cloud!</p>

<p><strong>Witnessed in the Convex Mirror: Earned Caviar</strong></p>
<p>In the present we are always escaping from<br>and falling back into, as the waterwheel of days<br>might sputter but continues to roll, continues&#133;<br>The dogs are grateful for the salmon trapped<br>by your fishwheel still circling itself on the Yukon<br>&mdash;they know you cannot feed them otherwise<br>which is to say, one of love&rsquo;s advantages is<br>empowering us to behave larger than we are<br>so that, unexpectedly by not just our childhood<br>abusers but by ourselves, we can go outside<br>our inheritance and actually feed someone<br>else. Thus, it is right for those fishing to cut<br>into the pink flesh and see a basket of eggs&mdash;<br>labor deserves more than its own reward<br>As for the gleaming pink pearls, they need<br> nothing else but their welcome brine exploding<br> against your tongue, causing you to raise your<br>face against a light suddenly so bright it paints<br>gold leaf against sky&rsquo;s blue ceiling. You are<br>forgiven for actually expecting God to appear</p>

<p><strong>Witnessed in the Convex Mirror: Euphemisms For Mortality</strong></p>
<p>And swerving easily away, as though to protect<br>what it advertises, the gaze bypasses the age<br>of beams and leaded panes&mdash;no one wishes<br>to look at the old unless they can be elevated<br>by euphemisms. Say, &ldquo;antique.&rdquo; Say, &ldquo;powerful.&rdquo; <br>Say, &ldquo;billionaire.&rdquo; Say, &ldquo;convex&rdquo; for widening<br>the gaze when focus means the revelation of<br>mortality. You wake up one morning and, unlike<br>yesterday, the hand is spotted with dark spots<br>the jowls hang, the breath catches on the third<br>step, and the prodigal child is at the door<br>with hand stretched for any inheritance. From<br>that point onward, everything you muster on<br>the piano shall be nostalgic and poignant. For<br>novels, you return to the Russians&mdash;at least <br>they live again when your trembling fingers<br>open their books. But you suspect no one will<br>read you, and you professed your entire life<br>that you are a poet. Damnation: <em>I am a poet</em></p>
