<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>estrella</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January I could not sleep, I was dead<br>In January I lived on a star</p>
<p>That month I could not decide how to walk in its light</p>
<p>My inception was focused to a pinpoint in my eyes<br>and breath was a shock of enmity, a spleen of bullets</p>
<p>I could not decide how to walk with my body&rsquo;s grottoes</p>
<p>I had come to lay it down as if it were an imaginary animal<br>inked with tattoos that said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>In January when I said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;<br>it was as though the words were turned aside, against me</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; on Bogota&#146;s plain<br>my heart in its chest palpitating as if a supplicant</p>
<p>In January a doorway opened on a new moon, a darkness</p>
<p>this star covered in white daffodils<br>this star that fractured my femur when I fell</p><p>to get up again I had to stalk the rock crags</p>
<p>to get up again I had to keep a visage that burned like candy<br>plucked from an orphan&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>In January I had to go back to the place where I fell down</p>
<p>I love you, I said, &amp; I love the whistle of the wind<br>through the holes in my head</p>
<p>I love you through the rended tissue of my shattered spine</p>
<p>I love you &amp; I feel like I could walk outta here<br>if only you would fuck off and let me be a while</p>
<p>In January I returned in a cloud of flesh that clung to the sleepless<br>as they marked the night</p>
<p>In January I marked the flesh that clung to God<br> who fell down and couldn&rsquo;t get up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>day of the sky corpse</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that day the sutures ripped</p>
<p>the sky became a wall of gauze</p>
<p>day of midnight sun</p>
<p>day of dark radiation</p>
<p>empire is built on love&rsquo;s decay&mdash;</p>
<p>day that gazes on a wound&rsquo;s terminus<br>and chides the gunman</p> 
<p>points left at the gash</p> 
<p>the blood covering my eyes from the sun</p>
<p>it becomes suspended in the air&mdash;</p>
<p>sun hung facing a mirror</p> 
<p>reflection searing memories onto the brain&mdash;</p>
<p>day they came to take me</p>
<p>the sky hardened until it fractured</p>
<p>I walked out to see a man kneeling on the ground</p>
<p>wearing a leash around his neck</p>
<p>the gunman poised above him&mdash;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cover my eyes again<br>
don&rsquo;t make me hang like the sun</p>
<p>so thirsty and frozen at the end</p>
<p>day my heart hung low<br>twitching with electric fervor</p>
<p>sky&rsquo;s corpse lurching down the mountain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>a long line of gunmen</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they wear their camoflauge pegged down<br>like steel birds on a weathervane</p>
<p>they wear their bodies coiled up like a fetus&mdash;</p>
<p>I walk with them hidden in my hood</p>
<p>hidden there my star burns brighter</p>
<p>it wears the dust of my body like a cloak&mdash;</p>
<p>the gunmen shoot me through the throat</p> 
<p>the bullets pass through me</p>
<p>a fleshy nebula<br>wearing the constellations of the zodiac<br>come up to the threshold of Xibalba</p>
<p>wherein the majesty of the sound of their revolution<br> as they scatter ever further from each other<br>is muted as I am mute</p>
<p>and jesus in his robe is mute</p>
<p>white daffodil</p>
<p>cloud of seed scattered by the wind</p>
<p>I vomit him out through the holes in my throat</p><p>the long line of gunmen in ritual procession<br>
falls out with him to coil at my feet</p>
<p>to cool and harden into a dragon&rsquo;s tail&mdash;</p>
<p>that it dash itself against the rock crags<br>and settle into a desert</p>
<p>that is my wish</p>
<p>that it redeem Egypt in the jungle</p>
<p>that it burst through the sodden foliage<br> 
and render visible the temple</p>
<p>the last king holding high his flaming sword</p>
<p>running barefoot at the Spanish</p>
<p>stopped in his tracks by a single arebusque</p>
<p>they will not find that Egypt</p> 
<p>they will not find it</p> 
<p>they will not find it in the patterns of ink<br>laced across my back</p>
<p>Egypt of the blood binding my body</p>
<p>Egypt of a form shrouded in the Angel&rsquo;s garment</p>
<p>Egypt that might redeem itself one day&mdash;</p>
<p>who will redeem the long line of gunemen<br>poised above me in bas relief </p>
<p>who will redeem me<br>and the landscape surrounding my body</p>
<p>who will raise a blade to their chests</p>
<p>who will hold it so tight his enemies have to cut off his hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>black coffin</em></p>
<p>the silence of those grasses along the plain</p>
<p><em>Los Llanos</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	extending to God<br>like a sulking woman extends her lip</p>
<p>a woman who flees<br>
who disappears to weep in the city&mdash;</p>
<p>I am disappeared, too<br>I also weep</p>
<p>my tears chase sorrow to star&rsquo;s center</p>
<p>those silences of belief</p>
<p>glory come back again to the face of God</p>
<p>face hung on the battlements when faith is lost</p>
<p>visage burning the garments from supplicant bodies<br>until the city is naked</p>
<p>she dances there through the heat of 100 summers</p>
<p>dances to a frequency emitting from a black coffin</p>
<p>the supplicants are torn to shreds<br>for refusing her hunger</p>
<p>hunger of the field and the cattle grazing</p> 
<p>hunger of God&rsquo;s heart in my heart</p>
<p>hunger of the auras of the damned<br>stealing light from my shoulder</p>
<p>hunger of the Colombian government<br>and the men who prop it up</p>
<p>hunger of those beasts seated as dignitaries<br> 
at the peace tables</p>
<p>hunger setting fire to the city</p>
<p>setting fire to her body in the garden&mdash;</p>
<p>she becomes infinite beneath me</p>
<p>the city smashes itself into her belly</p>
<p>the apoplexy will come on like a faucet</p>
<p>stigmata etched into the foreheads of the damned<br>as they gather beside the coffin</p>
<p>blood inside and out</p>
<p>my body&rsquo;s shadow in the vanishing light</p>
<p>as they walk in<br>the held daffodil peals in thunder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
