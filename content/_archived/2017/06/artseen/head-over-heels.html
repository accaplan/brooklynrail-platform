<p>When I experience Kay Rosen&rsquo;s text-based work, she tickles my inner word-nerd in the mind and heart, oftentimes coaxing a belly laugh. Her current solo exhibition, <em>H Is for House</em>, at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum once again draws out such delight.</p>

<p>Throughout her forty-year career, Rosen, a 2017 Guggenheim Fellow and trained linguist, has explored the visual potential of language&#8212;particularly letterforms&#8212;to be the building blocks of art that challenge (playfully or critically) contemporary culture&rsquo;s understanding of words. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been interested in the ability of letters to become the things they represent.&rdquo; Rosen imparts during an interview. &ldquo;They become the signified as well as the signifier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>H Is for House</em> is a collection of two wall paintings and fourteen works on paper. In these two-dimensional works, the words and letters can be read, as well as seen as objects. </p>

<p>In the atrium, viewers are greeted with <em>Head Over Heels</em> (2016), a monumental 16-by-16-foot wall painting. The word &ldquo;FALLOVER&rdquo; topples from above, evoking a waterfall, and, as LOVER dives vertically from FAL&rsquo;s edge, the feeling of falling in love. I&rsquo;m swooning, as I head into the gallery. </p>

<p>Inside, <em>H Is for House </em>(2017) is a two-part wall painting that covers opposing sides of the main room. On one wall, the H is right side up, large as a local Connecticut cottage, and includes the vertical text &ldquo;TWO STORY,&rdquo; with the center of the H dividing the words like a floor between stories. On the opposing wall, the H, flipped on its side, becomes a floor, ceiling, and wall that divides the house and the text &ldquo;TWO ROOM&rdquo;&#8212;as well as becoming the letter I. Cleverly, the wall painting uses the letterforms as the foundation for a house, this collection, and to spell out a greeting: HI. </p>

<p>Within the house that Rosen has created, visitors are treated to fourteen paintings on 22 &frac12;-by-15-inch white paper that explore the architectural nature of words as objects. Rosen explains that she sought to &ldquo;combine content and meaning so they merge to say the same thing.&rdquo; All the while, her works adhere to strict, self-imposed parameters: the letterforms can only span five or six lines; they must stack vertically on horizontal paper, like a portrait, and, with the exception of one work, convey the meaning in black typography&#8212;a remarkable departure from her frequent use of bold colors. </p>

<p>I gravitate to <em>Ledge </em>(2015). The word is painted vertically in all-capital letters, the L shifted slightly to the right of EDGE. This creates both a literal edge formed by a recessed block of letterforms, along with the free-falling motion of stepping off a ledge. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ledge is one of those self-made words. I think of it as found material,&rdquo; Rosen remarks &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really do that much to it&#8212;except to tweak it a little to make it become the thing that it says it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Dangle</em> (2015) reveals the word and its meaning at once. The first letter, D, anchors the word, while ANGLE is rendered beneath in a slanted line. <em>BrowNose </em>(2015) stacks BROW on top of NOSE in a T-formation in brown acrylic gouache, creating facial features as well as chuckle worthy quip. <em>Pivot</em> (2015), rendered twice in parallel lines, is anthropomorphic. Back to back, the letterform bodies stand upright on Ts (legs), while the top letter Ps (heads) face away from one another. </p>

<p>Rosen&rsquo;s work rose to prominence during the feminist movement&rsquo;s second wave in the 70s. She sees her work as both an exploration of meaning contained within words&#8212;encoded layers of history, privilege, and bias&#8212;as well as a space for voicing cultural critique. </p>

<p>In <em>Trickle Down</em> (2015), Rosen paints the letterforms in a drip-like formation. TRICK is spelled out horizontally, LE centered beneath, and DOWN stacked vertically below with one letter on top of another. &ldquo;All I did was divide it up, string it out, and arrange it,&rdquo; she explains to reveal that the economic policy, based on the notion that the wealth of those at the top flows down to the rest, is a trick. </p>

<p>In Kay Rosen&rsquo;s House there is much to discover. </p>
