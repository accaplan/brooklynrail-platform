Genesis tells of the sacred grove:
Roots soaked in cool water of astral seas, branches bathed by 
Silvery moonlight. I stand firmly here on a durable plinth of earth.
The<em> Frog Altar</em> looms huge above the ground. Paynes grey,
Sap green, masada ocher, burnt russet, porcelain-like
Smooth skin with earthbound monumentality; no simulation.</p>

<p>
Athens blue lifts the elevation.
He has walked the path that lies between shades of darkness
<span style="margin-left:40px;">And subtle chords of light.</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">A thruway that earlier guided Benjamin of Tudela.</span></p>

<p>
I hear small clacking sounds of the masons stacking 
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Creamy, mud bricks one by one with rice husks</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">To form the formidable pillars of capitals,</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">The foundations of classical order. </span></p>

<p>
Like Didymus the Blind who mastered dialectics 
And geometry, He, too, is ready to be gulped by the earth.
And the sea. And the stars that froze last week.</p>

<p>
Full frontal, atmospheric, dense,
<span style="margin-left:40px;"><em>Lent Painting</em> initiates, concrete and stationary</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Elements, then feeds endless Christological debates </span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">By medieval councils, Chalcedon &#8230;</span></p>

<p>
Traces of human hands along the edges of solid posts&#8212;
Fragile below the massive tympanum, they welcome and 
Enter the blind arcades in the Mosque of Kairouan.</p>

<p>
A vast, irregular Euclidean geometry rubs against the
Trowelled spatulas, glides&#8212;ragged&#8212;across countless
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Intervals of this domestic architecture, across</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Interludes of the battle cry and creed.</span>
A marvel to appeal both to emotion and the mind &#8230;</p>

<p>
As painting in space prefigures painting in place,
<span style="margin-left:40px;">Time and timelessness perpetually persist</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">The people he wished he&rsquo;d known are here,</span>
<span style="margin-left:40px;">They&rsquo;re alive indeed.</span></p>
