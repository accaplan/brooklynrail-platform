title: Alyson Hannigan Ordered Me To Be Made
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Alyson, bitter letter, my magic
  I&rsquo;m not exactly <em>in love</em> with how this is turning out</p>
<p>
I look distracted too mellow entirely normal
  I look calm adjusted heavy with whimsy kingly
  iconography dripping from me don&rsquo;t you hate that
  when this happens turning 
  <span style="margin-left:100px;">out Alyson, paint me</span>
  bowing to flowers (narcissus) or some other 
  repeating grace worth being bitchy about &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like Williams
  undoing the world in his cleaving variable beginning (Did I 
  turn out like that?) his raging liquid music edged so hard 
  in the present, &ldquo;rich in savagery&rdquo; he says at the end 
  of <em>Spring and All </em>
  <span style="margin-left:100px;">When I read that book I imagine Williams</span>
  is Tom Waits and T.S. Eliot is The Eagles, the former&rsquo;s
  monstrous delight leering against the latter&rsquo;s breezy
  symptomatic melodies, both disastrously male
  but Waits feels it. Terrific.
  <span style="margin-left:165px;">Alyson, do I look like that?</span>
  At Tom Waits&rsquo; 2011 induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
  Neil Young stands at the podium like a gorgeous dirty goat and says
  <span style="margin-left:250px;">&ldquo;This next man is undescribable</span>
  and I&rsquo;m here to describe him. This man
  is a great, he&rsquo;s sort of a performer singer actor magician
  spirit guide changling and I&rsquo;ve seen him standing 
  in a bunch of dust and I thought I saw you know sparkling 
  things coming off of him and then I looked at him 
  while he was singing and I said is my vision going I&rsquo;m seeing 
  three maybe four people up there now and they&rsquo;re all seeming 
  to be waiting for the other one to finish so that they can come in 
  and this other one would just whistle at me and then 
  one would speak in a kind of speaking in tongues 
  kind of voice and then the Eagles covered it.&rdquo; Oh my god
  Alyson, will you paint me like that, gnawed on, split by dreams?</p>
<p>
I look like Rack, you remember, the warlock magic dealer 
  in <em>Buffy</em> who told you, who told Willow, &ldquo;you taste
  like strawberries&rdquo; before your and Amy&rsquo;s demonic, orgasmic
  trip, your inverted surrealistic pillow, feed your head 
  <span style="margin-left:250px;">feed your pretty red head.</span>
  But is that me saying that about you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or is that my portrait?</p>
<p>
In Season 6, Episode 22 <em>Grave</em>, I look like the grave
  That&rsquo;s the one where Giles comes back a coven-dad with power
  to take on dark Willow undoing the world of men killing 
  women everyone so desirous of love and the dead fucking
  the living in the rubble, the intricate ship. Willow overloads 
  on magic, overhears the world of people suffering together
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much it&rsquo;s all too much&rdquo; she says in her refusal her 
  red hair black eyes black at the red end 
  <span style="margin-left:100px;">(Where&rsquo;d you get that red hair, Nick?) Xander</span>
  normaled down like a man on the satanic bluff, suddenly that exists 
  <span style="margin-left:50px;">in the show like a soul</span>
  what&rsquo;s needed to be real performing the story strawberries pain
  the only mother in the series is dead</p>
<p>
I look like Patricia in Godard&rsquo;s <em>Breathless </em>when she says
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put all this in my book&rdquo; the incongruous surfaces
  of a French new wave weekend purring together
  in their na&iuml;ve infancies founded on a violence jade
  static we&rsquo;re brought up to feel is charming but oh I do
  adore that look, that book, it sheds itself in knots
<span style="margin-left:250px;">but the hair isn&rsquo;t right</span></p>
<p>
I look split as much as possible so I&rsquo;m reading (crying) red-headed
  Alice Neel&rsquo;s biography <em>The Art of Not Sitting Pretty</em> 
  <span style="margin-left:300px;">&ldquo;realism can be as good</span> 
  as abstraction&rdquo; she says about a 1946 portrait &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see picnics on the grass 
  and all that stuff&rdquo; 
  <span style="margin-left:100px;">&ldquo;I was abandoned I didn&rsquo;t feel it I was&rdquo; &ldquo;This is called</span>
  The Futility of Effort&rdquo; I love 
  <span style="margin-left:200px;">the articulate blues draped around her </span>
  portraits&rsquo; faces suffering as obsession, intimacy 
  worshipping hard on canvas, it&rsquo;s not always going to be charming</p>

I dream</p>
<p>
I overhear Alice Notley a dream &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know </p>
<p>
if I&rsquo;m a good person&rdquo; she says &ldquo;I had to cut off </p>
<p>
part of myself / for this family to believe </p>
<p>
me / to belong to what surrounds me&rdquo; </p>
<p>
cramming her magic in a dark backpack (she leaves) </p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not a choice it&rsquo;s a position I think </p>
<p>
listening to C to J &ldquo;wanting to chew my own </p>
<p>
arm off / wishing I could hang out with my poems&rdquo; </p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a position toward light 1 white lamp I keep </p>
<p>
in the future from my position (crying) in the dream </p>
<p>
the bones of my mothers in the grave I am</p>
<p>
dug in the yard the grave of my mothers heavy piled </p>
<p>
living &amp; him I walk himly crying himish to it All </p>

</div>
<p>
&amp; in class the issue is &ldquo;what is wrong with sex&rdquo; </p>
<p>
as a question to read &ldquo;The Waste Land&rdquo; but I hate </p>
<p>
that poem its male diagnosis oiled as a promise</p>
<p>
of recovery as if the present isn&rsquo;t a body flower</p>
<p>
slay noise I just quoted a mother (crying) let me</p>
<p>
be clear: this isn&rsquo;t a choice it&rsquo;s worship letter</p>
<p>
body wet into wet where&rsquo;d you get that dream</p>
<p>
like me the poem lays out 2 versions </p>
<p>
of death 2 versions of life but I&rsquo;m not studying</p>
<p>
that division I&rsquo;m writing (crying) as a lilac splits </p>
<p>
into my friend&rsquo;s kitchen dreaming a certain direction </p>
<p>
slanting jade static should I be clearer in Middle English</p>
<p>
I read that poem &ldquo;Alisoun&rdquo; but time is not a division in it</p>
<p>
Ich am in hire baundoun Alisoun &amp; I we are turning out</p>
<p>
I am in her power Alyson in the kitchen Ich habbe iyerned yore</p>
<p>
Betere is tholien while sore does not translate pain flower</p>
<p>
kitchen floor I read &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be together, but you&rsquo;re </p>
<p>
always with me in my heart&rdquo; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>
to my heart&rdquo; she writes in a blue envelope I barely remember</p>
<p>
her hair is me is it a choice a dead land living forms my mother </p>
<p>
depending on possession of the child they call that custody </p>
<p>
I hate that poem where there&rsquo;s a man in me in the poem</p>
<p>
women are completely inept &amp; ruin the world</p>
<p>
he says with emotions so Eliot has to pretend to surrender </p>
<p>
to what&rsquo;s beyond the male see modern ego</p>
<p>
as if being made were a law (one couch and matching chair)</p>
<p>
it&rsquo;s been a bad year for fun &amp; all because of dick Mark says</p>
<p>
not symbols in my position I&rsquo;m lying (phonograph</p>
<p>
&amp; tape deck) between the defendants in the documents </p>
<p>
like a man jade static frothing breeding song I la la</p>
<p>
jug jug can&rsquo;t translate what light &amp; love surrenders</p>
<p>
(Cooler &amp; Jug) in the disaster&rsquo;s (China Set) Middle Class </p>
<p>
sound of lilacs seething bitter letter where devotion is</p>
<p>
crushing strawberries into my red hair I&rsquo;m asking </p>
<p style="margin-left:250px;">
what is a choice?</p>
<p>
potion not a portrait a looking dying sparkling thing or spring</p>
<p>
being a list a name is what made me </p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been studying you know dreaming </p>
<p>
of heavy melting snow like love Betere is tholien </p>
<p>
while sore it is better to suffer greatly for a time</p>
<p>
where the walls don&rsquo;t hold soft loose viscera</p>
<p>
a bitch a song in me is a family the question</p>
<p>
a castle did this ever happen (crying) I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>
studying in the best interest of </p>
<p>
All things, the child</p>
<p>
fuck your peaceful
<span style="margin-left:150px;">easy feeling</p>
