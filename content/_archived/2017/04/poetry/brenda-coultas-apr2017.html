<em>A Villenelle</em></p>

<div style="margin-left:30px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
My scar has a face that others see 
  A face that walks ahead of me 
  A rupture in the bark of a tree </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
To a future I cannot foresee 
  I own my wounds to a degree, 
  My scar has a face that others see </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Although invisible to me 
  The rough badges I decree 
  A rupture in the bark of a tree </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Each scar sings a Blakean song 
  Splinters of summer wrongs 
  My scar has a face that others see </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Of sweet babes and losses, 
  Deceit and double crosses 
  A rupture in the bark of a tree </p><br/>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Beneath the frost, 
  These wounds exact a cost 
  My scar has a face that others see 
  A rupture in the bark of a tree </p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12.5pt;">&ldquo;Momentarily&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left:30px;">
<p style="line-height:2em;">
&ldquo;We are held here momentarily&rdquo; 
  said the conductor, 
  on an island off the coast of Manhattan 
  by the silhouette of an asylum, where they make skeleton keys 
  out of rainbows, and out of actual skeletons 
  from the catacombs of the Marble cemetery 
  where people turn into greek marbles 
  like a game of statues 
  industrial green 
  umbrellas are made here 
  rib by rib 
  and shoes, this an island of cobblers of roman sandals. 
  and we are held here monetarily, 
  mortality. </p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12.5pt;">&ldquo;Night Terrors&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
My luggage is stuffed with fear, it&rsquo;s heavy, this fear; there are 
people, friends even, who have that thing, that indescribable 
thing, sometimes I, too, see it in them, and know it&rsquo;s not me, for 
my language is describable, probable, likely, pedestrian, com-
mon, and my night terrors are made of black ice.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12.5pt;">
&ldquo;The Writing of an Hour&rdquo; <br/>
  Hour I </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
This is my hour of writing, an hour of writing that I give to myself 
and to the world, this is the hour to write, to fill the endless page, the 
void, the maw, and to write through this gap, to get to where I must 
go.&nbsp; Like a beloved visitor who cannot stay, this hour of writing is 
pulled from the daily tasks of putting dishes in order, gathering dust 
motes into balls, gathering the balls onto the scoop to the bin; the 
dust is older than the hour, and was made before and after I was born 
and as I sleep I breathe in the microbes, the dust of the hour, the sig-
nificant and the inconsequential, and I consider the hours that lay 
ahead like bullets, waiting to be fired or to be consumed by fire. </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Low radio bleed-through, partner walking and scrapping something 
like dried egg off a plate, an hour after breakfast, and the hour before 
in the bath, the laptop by the tub but out of reach of the splatter, or is 
it better to say, the displacement of water, the waves a body makes 
as it enters another body, laps over the edge? I should learn some-
thing during bath time, so I listen to a talk on Peruvian ruins and 
their effects on local economies, the speaker says, &ldquo;&#133; Like village 
women selling while preserving traditional crafts.&rdquo;&nbsp; TED talks on 
autoplay, learning as I soak and after drying off, I could pass an exit 
exam. </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Shutting the lid to be with my own thoughts about how to reducing 
cleverness in writing, to consider an assignment of describing lost 
sounds, like all the sounds of <em>Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,</em> but mostly 
how to overcome writer&rsquo;s block, and how to do two things at once 
exceptionally well, and think I&rsquo;d like to drop acid.</p>

<p style="line-height:2em;">
Heating soup in the kitchen, even though this is the hour of writing, 
glance at three french baguettes that need to be tossed into the woods 
for animals to eat: back on the bed, propped up and keyboarding, 
sniffles, and looking at blue socks on my feet, and this view of green 
grass despite the season, leaves of curled brown, like brown 
butcher&rsquo;s paper and the summer lawn chairs. Seed heads of over-
grown border weeds, and what about that humpback whale videoed 
in Hudson River, a singular traveler, through heavy boat traffic and 
if the whale is lost or sick, how lonely or maybe not, is this mammal, 
who surfaces to breathe. </p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12.5pt;">Hour II</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
  This is the hour of writing, rain and dark days of winter. Colds and 
  crap, of umbrellas and hate when the wind blows them ribs out.&nbsp; My 
  husband follows me from room to room. 
 <p style="line-height:2em;margin-top:-1em;"><span style="margin-left:20px;">Is my domestic dust more like &ldquo;The Story of an Hour&rdquo; or
 &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper?&rdquo; </span></p>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12.5pt;">Hour III </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
  New one tonight 
  small anvil on a metal grate 
  I have never heard a gas lamp hiss 
  despite the works 
  protruding from the wall </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
I cannot distinguish fact from fiction 
  houses from accessories 
  bowls from pitchers 
  armoires from wardrobes 
  carriages from shopping carts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p style="line-height:2em;margin-left:40px;">Blue is the eye of the sea and red is stationary of desire</p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
I knew a woman who lived in a loft that once was a sewing factory 
and&nbsp; she thought of her tin ceiling pattern that looked like this ( ) as 
pussies. </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Later on,&nbsp; she blew hot glass into a replica of her own anatomy and 
became transparent for the glass version of herself was more appro-
priate for fitting the wand into the body&rsquo;s cavities. For example, her 
uterus plays film noir and talking to her is analogous to eating a jar 
of fire. </p>
<p style="line-height:2em;">
Like Goldilocks sampling from every bowl, I steal into the ceramic 
shop to eat from white plates as thin as saltines, some cabbage-
shaped dishes that the British are so proud of, and lobsters-handle 
platters. I carve houses carved out of a roadside bank of clay, ga-
rages and arches court the danger of collapse and they do collapse on 
the best matchbox cars, even those with suicide doors, and when I
am the little match girl, I obsess over haunted houses as much as 
Shirley Jackson as I draw you into a warren of rooms. </p>
