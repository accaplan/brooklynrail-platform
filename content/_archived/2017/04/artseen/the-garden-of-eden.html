<p>
Symphony of light and refrains of machine unconscious
Plummet this anomalous and unflustered Eden into
Deliberations of unequal passages,
And arousals of our senses, sense of &#8230;</p>

<p>
The appreciable accumulation of an intense, unraveling duel 
Between symmetrical speckles, flecks, dabs and blotches, 
Smudged spots and cool asymmetry; a utopia of vertical pillars
Shines against the tan desert sand.</p>

<p>
Light is the seclusive lord of universal acceptance
Preceding the mechanization of private folklore, 
Squeezed strenuously across transparent veils, filmic automatons,
Onto rolls of radiant color.</p>

<p>
The orchestra begins long before dawn.
Someone whispers, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too splendid to confess.&rdquo;
Time, space, elemental commitment is to nowhere
But here. Everyone is welcomed.</p>
