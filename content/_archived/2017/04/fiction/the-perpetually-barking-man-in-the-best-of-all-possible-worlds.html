title: The Perpetually Barking Man  in the Best of All Possible Worlds
---


<p>Abdel-Chakour waited a moment longer, then left the caf&#233; and wandered down the streets at random. He felt humiliated in his entire outsized being. It was a great humiliation, equal to his standing. It filled him completely. He buttoned his baggy canvas jacket in an attempt to cover himself. The lyrics of the song he&rsquo;d heard on Emad-el-Dine Street resounded once again in his ears. &ldquo;I am a poor man&#8230;in a disastrous state.&rdquo; What a song! You had to be the son of a deaf woman to sing like that. Abdel-Chakour quickened his pace, his mind filled with homicidal thoughts. After walking for half an hour, he recalled a small bar on a quiet street where you could get a glass of spirits for only one piaster.</p>

<p>Other than its shortage of customers, there was nothing remarkable about this bar where Abdel-Chakour had already come several times. At the moment, Abdel-Chakour could see a man whose age could not be determined, struggling to drown in alcohol a sorrow that quite obviously intended to survive. Sitting down across from him, Abdel-Chakour observed the man in silence. He was shabbily dressed and you could tell he hadn&rsquo;t shaved for several days. One utterly strange detail: the man, without advance warning or apology, began to bark feebly, like a dying dog. This way of expressing oneself in public greatly troubled Abdel-Chakour. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all. He became even more concerned when he saw the man leave his own table to come sit with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way I am,&rdquo; said the man. And in pronouncing these words, he seemed to introduce himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An honor to meet you,&rdquo; Abdel-Chakour answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I bark?&rdquo; the other man responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not disturbing you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, Abdel-Chakour sighed by way of response. The man did not worry him now because he was speaking a human language. However, after a short time, the man began barking again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way I am,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I already know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger made a face that signified so many infinitely painful things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. Not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t seem completely drunk. He was even behaving vey earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; said Abdel-Chakour. </p>

<p>This extraordinary man was making him forget the frustrations of his evening. And he didn&rsquo;t feel up to antagonizing him in any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; the stranger began. &ldquo;I am very poor. A while ago, things were even worse. You know what I mean? I want to talk to you about a particular day, that fateful day when I began to bark for the first time. First I need to tell you that I am an accountant by trade. Yes, I was the accountant for the most prosperous brothel in the city. It was a beautiful brothel, with almost a dozen of the most alluring females. The madam earned a lot of money and paid me generously. I was as happy as a pimp. But then, I don&rsquo;t know what sort of incident occurred. One evening, I found the brothel closed, a police officer standing near the door. I left without asking any questions. But none of that is of any importance. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting. I want to tell you about the day I began to bark for the first time in my life. That&rsquo;s some story! It was an awfully hot day. I didn&rsquo;t have a penny to my name and I was wandering the streets under a pitiless sun. Countless hours had gone by since my last meal. I&rsquo;d forgotten the taste of food. I was amazed to see people eating in restaurants. I was feverish. Everything around me was becoming blurry and disappearing into a terrifying distance. I felt myself melting in the heat. So, I wonder by what stroke of fate my gaze fell upon that disturbing signboard: &ldquo;Animal Protection Society.&rdquo; At first, the sign didn&rsquo;t inspire me with confidence. But then, because of my fever, I began to believe that the animals it mentioned could perhaps be people like me: the hungry and the poor. I thought I was saved. But not at all.</p>

<p>Here the stranger interrupted his tale and let out a few low, plaintive barks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, I&rsquo;m telling you. The head of this Animal Protection Society to whom I spoke explained to me very clearly that, sadly, the animal called man was of no interest whatsoever to them and would have to manage on his own. I told him I would gladly give up my humanity if it would allow him to help me in my misfortune. This offer made him furious. He called in a few subordinates and ordered them to throw me out. I persevered, adamantly refusing to consider myself a human creature, but in vain; those men beat me with their fists and dragged me out onto the street. It&rsquo;s then that I heard the little dog barking. I don&rsquo;t know what came over me all of a sudden. No doubt it was the fever. I too began to bark for quite a while, just like that, without realizing what I was doing. The men who were mistreating me were so surprised that they immediately released me. Then I fainted. I don&rsquo;t know for how long I was unconscious, but when I came to, the sickness was in me for good. At first I couldn&rsquo;t bark very well, but by learning from the dogs, I&rsquo;ve just about managed to make myself understood. That&rsquo;s the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abdel-Chakour stopped listening. He paid for his drink and ran away. The man barked after him for a long time. </p>
