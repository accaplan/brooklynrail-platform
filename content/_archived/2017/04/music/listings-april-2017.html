<li>April 3: Nate Wooley <em>Complete Syllables Music</em> release at <a href="http://ibeambrooklyn.com">IBeam</a>. Trumpeter, composer, and let&#8217;s say all-around-arts-administrator, Wooley is releasing a marvelous four CD box of music connected to spoken language. Out on his own <a href="http://www.pleasureofthetext.com">Pleasure of the Text</a> imprint, the music is equal successful as experiment and as immersion in Wooley&#8217;s trumpet playing. If you miss the show, catch him on our upcoming April podcast.</li><br />

Zion and veteran of the Montreal music scene Rebecca Foon, performing as Saltland, celebrates the release of her new record, <em>A Common Truth</em>, with a show in Brooklyn. As evidenced on the recently shared track &#147;Forward Eyes II,&#148; Foon&#146;s cello brings a subtle melodic element to a minimalist, ambient sound that slowly, quietly builds.<p><iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/312309999&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></p></li><br />

<li>April 12: Cory Smythe at the <a href="http://jazzgallery.nyc">Jazz Gallery</a>. Even in a scene where musicians playing in ensembles and situations across genres, pianist Cory Smythe stands out. His realms are classical music, new music, jazz, improvisation, and experimentalism. His own music-making is fascinatingly plastic, with originals and old-time tunes parsed through alternate-universe type acoustic and electronic dimensions. This gig celebrates his solo release, <em>A U T O TROPHS</em>.<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2366075022/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1481321390/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://corysmythe.bandcamp.com/album/a-u-t-o-trophs">A U T O TROPHS by Cory Smythe</a></iframe></p></li><br />
