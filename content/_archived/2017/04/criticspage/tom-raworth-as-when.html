<p>Tom Raworth&rsquo;s poetry is one of the great and pure pleasures of the contemporary literary landscape. It is writing that gets its work done quickly and cleanly, is neither didactic nor &ldquo;difficult,&rdquo; and stimulates the mind as much as the eye and ear. <em>As When </em>spans Raworth&rsquo;s writing of some fifty years (1963 &#150; 2013), and from first page to last, it is clear that padding out the poem has never been an option: Raworth&rsquo;s movement through time is toward ever-greater compression&#151;a restless homing-in on a perceived center he has described as &ldquo;pure politics.&rdquo; Of his process, he has written: &ldquo;My &lsquo;method&rsquo; is the essence of simplicity. I write down fragments of language passing through my mind that interest me enough after thought has played with them for me to imagine I might like to read them.&rdquo; The resulting poetry combines a lyricism shorn of self-regard with an all but transparent receptivity to the voices. It is writing that inhabits the present as fully as art allows; that it is also built to last&#151;is literature, of an absolute quality&#151;is not the least of Raworth&rsquo;s extraordinary achievements. Jack Kerouac may have been &ldquo;the last to try to get all the way round before the bell rang for time,&rdquo; as Raworth suggests in a 1971 letter to Edward Dorn, but it is Raworth who takes the decisive step further, realizing that &ldquo;the shortest distance between two points is to be everywhere.&rdquo; That scattering, as Dorn was quick to point out, is a realism. </p>
