title: 'Alejandro Miguel Justino Crawford, Egress'

<p><em>Egress</em>. To leave; to exit from. From classical Latin <em>&#275;gressus: the</em> action of going out, aperture, outlet, or digression. In figurative use, from the 8th century: death.</p>
<p>In 2014, Alejandro Miguel Justino Crawford released a poem entitled <em>Egress</em> that operates within an immersive 3D application for Mac or PC. The poem drops the user into a literal field of signs. <em>Egress</em> features a simulated valley populated by various elements including construction marquees endlessly streaming haphazard enjambments of text, a flurry of verbal detritus falling from the sky, and an ambient soundtrack. Like the user at the console, the reader in the game is immobile, stuck, bound to a static position, left only with the limited capacity to browse: of course, there is nowhere to go.</p>
<p>While dozens of road signs blare atrocious assemblages of spam text, one marquee offers something resembling an egress:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">Because the producti<br>
on of forms in a new
medium re-signifies
their constitutive
elements, such differen
tial functions can be
explicitly foregrou
nded and aesthetically
investigated, particul
arly in transitional
moments.</p>
<p>Embedded within the manifold horrors of the Internet&#151;normalized performances of algorithmic racism, misogyny, and exploitation, to name only those screened in the poem&#151;Crawford&rsquo;s interactive poetics presents a software update to existential queries in a transitional moment. There is no exit to <em>Egress</em>. It is network culture distilled. Even the escape button is powerless. Instead, the poem demands the user must quit the program, keep reading, seek tactics of egress, even where none appear. </p>
