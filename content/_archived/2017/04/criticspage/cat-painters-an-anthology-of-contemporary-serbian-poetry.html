<p>What Dubravka Djuri&#263; &amp; Biljana Obradovi&#263; have done in <em>Cat Painters</em> is to produce an anthology-as-assemblage, a dynamic composition that offers in its own right a new poetry &amp; poetics that can now enrich our own sense of what&rsquo;s still possible in poetry. The range of the poems presented here is remarkable, a true avant-garde moment as a reflection of the turbulent times from which it comes. Far from being a gathering of the already known, it is, like the best &amp; rarest of our anthologies, an opening to a treasury of language (word &amp; image) that one could hardly have imagined before this. But the sighting, once it occurs, will not soon be forgotten.</p>
