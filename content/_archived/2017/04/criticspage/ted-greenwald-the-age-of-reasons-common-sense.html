<p>Ted Greenwald and I were colleagues in a sense, in that we were both guardians of the Poetry Project, he as long-time board member, me as director. He was also, technically, my boss&#151;part of the governing body that hired me for the job, except we both believed &ldquo;I be my own boss / I be my own police.&rdquo; As well read in small-press poetry as I was upon moving to N.Y.C. in 2005, I didn&rsquo;t know Ted&rsquo;s work until I found his book <em>Common Sense</em> in a box in the basement of the church. Many people have written insightful things about his singular style. Curtis Faville, publisher of the original edition of <em>Common Sense</em>, nailed it for me when he said, &ldquo;Greenwald's style depends upon the rhythmic triggers that set unconscious thought processes into action. The poems become echo-chambers; or function perhaps as a &lsquo;ghost tracking&rsquo; of stray particles in linear accelerators.&rdquo; So I&rsquo;ll work from there. When Ted was in hospice, I always had one of his books in my bag. I read &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo; from <em>The Age of Reasons</em> to my therapist who later told me he bought the book. I read from <em>Common Sense</em> to another friend who ordered the reprint for a birthday present for her father. This is the rhythmic trigger effect. You can&rsquo;t hear Ted without wanting to hear more Ted.</p>
<p>This was true for me even in our phone conversations and emails. I would jot down something in my notebook that caught my ear with a &ldquo;TG&rdquo; after it. One of these made it into my poem &ldquo;austerity measures&rdquo;: &ldquo;right dog. right time.&rdquo; Another is stowed in my memory. In late May 2016, I camped for a couple of nights at Watch Hill, Fire Island. He told me a story about being there ages ago, and seeing some remarkable Fiddlehead ferns. I sent him a picture of some other kind of fern saying &ldquo;not Fiddle Head but&rdquo; and he wrote back, &ldquo;Excellent foins,&rdquo; which makes me smile to this day.</p>
