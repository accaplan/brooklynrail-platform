<p>In 1958, a budgie from Newcastle, U.K. named Sparkie received an award for having the largest vocabulary of any known bird. Raised by Mattie Williams, as a surrogate for her lack of children, Sparkie&rsquo;s vocabulary of 531 words, 383 sentences and eight complete nursery rhymes was prodigious and initiated a performing, endorsement, and recording career. Dodds and Thurston, with <em>I, Sparkie</em>, explore Sparkie&rsquo;s (and Mattie&rsquo;s) biography. They include a fascinating series of archival transcripts, essays, photographs and recordings (included on a CD) that explore Sparkie&rsquo;s intelligence and how his exceptional vocabulary undermines our assumptions of cognition and speech. Sparkie was a celebrity, famous for speaking people&rsquo;s words. His performances, incited by Mattie&rsquo;s conversational prompts, uncannily suggest more contemporary (human) celebrities and politicians who parrot the words of their handlers and funders.</p>
<p><em>I, Sparkie</em> was published by Information as Material&#151;Simon Morris and Nick Thurston&rsquo;s U.K.-based press&#151;placing the book within a back-catalogue primarily concerned with international conceptual and aleatory writing. Poetically, the implications of <em>I, Sparkie</em>, fall within the purview of Conceptualism. Implicitly, <em>I, Sparkie</em> undermines the human monopoly on literature, hinting at the potential for anthropomorphic authors to create text for an audience of non-human readers. For while Sparkie may insist &ldquo;they call me pretty Sparkie / I&rsquo;m just a little bird,&rdquo; the size of his audience eclipsed that of most poets, and suggests that originality is for the birds.</p>
