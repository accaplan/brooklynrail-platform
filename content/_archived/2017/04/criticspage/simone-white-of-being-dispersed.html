<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that shade throwing, shit talking, side-eying and other black rhetorical approaches, as practiced on Black Twitter and hot 16&rsquo;s, may have a <em>Lyrical Ballads </em>effect on certain strains of contemporary poetry, and that to assume they are best fit for light work misses their weight. &nbsp;<br>
  To wit: Simone White&rsquo;s <em>Of Being Dispersed</em> talks shit. Erudite she is, certainly. Any of her lines might be a spring-loaded launch pad, quick to shuttle a reader up into a cartoon where the blood is real. But she&rsquo;s also investigating signifyin(g) and profanity, thus a kiss-off poem like &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Nuzzle Me Fucker Maker&rdquo; performs a meta-dirty dozening that ends with the speaker using a plaything (diegetically: a Tinker Toy; (non) diegetically: language itself) to put in work. &ldquo;You and Me Are Not Friends, OK?&rdquo; nitty-gritties like a choice fractalization of Millie Jackson.<br>
  Regarding the aforementioned blood (and what&rsquo;s profane): the sequence, &ldquo;Preliminary Notes on Street Attacks&rdquo; is ratcheted up by tensions between Steadicam documentary:</p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#133;a lady too<br>
<br>
told me last week not to roll my eyes at her
a few days after George Zimmerman was acquitted<br>
</p>
<p>and straight-faced, tragically ridiculous, though practical(!) Black Lives coaching&#151;such as how best to be in danger if one must hope for white rescue.</p>
<p>These cold shifts often happen swiftly, but what remains constant is a side-eye so virtuosic that it observes sideways shit plumb. Reading <em>Of Being Dispersed, </em>I laughed a lot and I&rsquo;m still thinking of how much that might look like crying.</p>
