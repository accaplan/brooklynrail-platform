<p><em>Spontaneous Particulars</em> is an essay, performance score, artist&rsquo;s book, and manifesto. It is, in the artist&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;a collaged swan song to the old ways.&rdquo; Longtime readers of Susan Howe will recognize here the method and ethics underscoring <em>My Emily Dickinson</em> and <em>The Birth-Mark</em>, as well as her collage poems from <em>That This</em>; they will find both a near-mystical account of a subject researching and reveling in the sanctuary of the library, alongside the forceful expression of a modernist will, one collecting the detritus of effaced histories to construct a shimmering new plane of knowledge and engagement.</p>
<p>They will also discover a more emphatic sense of urgency and nostalgia. Howe writes, &ldquo;As they evolve, electronic technologies are radically transforming the way we read, write, and remember. The nature of archival research is in flux; we need to see and touch objects and documents; now we often merely view the same material on a computer screen.&rdquo; This imperative to &ldquo;see and touch objects and documents&rdquo;&#151;to acknowledge how we learn from and are affected by the <em>materiality</em> of our reading materials&#151;propels the form of <em>Spontaneous Particulars</em>. Woven throughout <em>Spontaneous Particulars</em> are reproductions of manuscript pages (from Gertrude Stein, Jonathan Edwards), images of 18th-century embroidered silk and 19th-century lace patterns, and memos from the prescription pad of &ldquo;William C. Williams, M.D.&rdquo; The book enacts a phenomenology of the archive, and Howe, nobly humanist, leads her readers into the archive by bringing such samples to them. The water&rsquo;s fine, she tells us, let&rsquo;s dive in together.</p>
<p>Still, I go back to these Williams lines, quoted at the book&rsquo;s beginning: </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">How much?<br>
How much?
How much does it cost
to love the locus tree
in bloom?</p>
<p><em>How much does it cost?</em> What Howe calls &ldquo;spontaneous particulars&rdquo; can only arise under structured, maintained <em>generals</em>: access to a research library; a quiet desk bequeathed and protected by librarians, guards, concrete walls; transportation; childcare; hours free from other (paying) work. And in a phenomenological reading of the library&rsquo;s corpus, isn&rsquo;t the reader&rsquo;s own, particular corpus one of the phenomena? Isn&rsquo;t how we &ldquo;see and touch objects and documents&rdquo; affected by how we <em>see</em> our varying selves, how our many and differing bodies feel such <em>touch</em>? </p>
<p>Howe writes, </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">Poetry has no proof nor plan nor evidence by decree or in any other way [&#133;] The inward ardor I feel while working in research libraries is intuitive. It&rsquo;s a sense of self-identification and trust, or the granting of grace in an ordinary room, in a secular time. </p>
<p>The material of poetry can grant us this grace, she reveals. But now let's consider the material conditions that will grant us this &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; room.</p>
