<p>These poems take us to strange questions: if you bed someone and then learn more about them, is the truth a replacement for the first impressions, or were the impressions a replacement for the truth? Syntax units follow each other in a way that leads us where we aren&rsquo;t often prone to go. Reading these is an adventure where something is always shimmering just beyond. The fourth poem and the last are both called &ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; and are about two entirely different modes of meaning. Or are they&#133;? The detritus of a middle-class childhood here and there erupts to litter lines and poetic paragraphs. Can these stand in for or &ldquo;replace&rdquo; (a word that Fitzgerald uses often) something more meaningful about his and our world. There is a lot to think about here; and a lot of ways to think about what&rsquo;s on your and Fitzgerald&rsquo;s mind. It&rsquo;s quite a success.</p>
