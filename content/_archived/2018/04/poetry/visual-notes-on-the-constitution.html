<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a right becomes a compulsion the empowered become cannibals.</p>
<p>When a suggestion becomes an order the disobedient dogs are contained.</p>
<p>The web masters have tried to reinstate Pursuit but were met by a socius</p>
<p>of howling dogs who had a country and were therefore arrogant.</p>
<p>Above my poetry palace is writ: &ldquo;You need me because you are not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am Metaparanoia: I am the Maker who works for a bigger Maker.</p>
<p>I posesss meta-faux-innocence but I don&rsquo;t collaborate with metaphysics.</p>
<p>I'm on my way to The Virgin-in-the-Grave to get my Messi@ ID.</p>
<p>This is me breast-feeding in the snow holding a bucket of sour cherries.</p>
<p>I sold eggs and onions in town, had lunch with Dr. Klaus Hysteria,</p>
<p>bought antique vibrator for M. from the Black Hawk Pawn Shop,</p>
<p>uploaded a blackberry emoji and saved it for you to put in your ear.</p>
<p>I established two clubs: the Virgin Memory Club Sunday mornings</p>
<p>and the Quadrilateral-Movement-Gym in a vacant storefront in my head.</p>
<p>Women who build homes think only wine is faster than poetry. Ha!</p>
<p>Watch the pot where sex-in-context books are stirring capitalist junkies.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of ethics without muscle makes hair grow on forehead,</p>
<p>credit chokes the flow of ideas, debt insures social stability, slavery.</p>
<p>The lack of courage for renewal is appalling in such weak flesh.</p>
<p>A druggy mailed an anti-idea from a bookstore into my friend&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>She flipped when he opened his pop tent in her crypt. The dead surprise!</p>
<p>For the right wings try our fascist chickens. They are pledged to scandal.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m technology, I have nothing to say but I&rsquo;m saying it anyway.</p>
<p>What does this say? I insist. I&rsquo;m not saying anything, I&rsquo;m technology.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re not here I am saying other things that say nothing.</p>
<p>We say a lot of nothings when there aren&rsquo;t any humans around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m painting at you not painting you but you&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s you anyway.</p>
<p>This is the La-De-Da.Doc if you want to meet my beautiful hairdo.</p>
<p>Grootan Ustashi kisses the wall with the mezuzzah while I hold his fez.</p>
<p>Yesterday my toy broke up with me just before climax: it was jealous.</p>
<p>Skeumorphs are landing at the rate of 600/day around this poet.</p>
<p>When life seems more interesting than writing I introduce both to death.</p>
<p>Then we see how much they weigh and how things stand (or not).</p>
<p>Five lives, five fairy tales is how porno disguises itself.</p>
<p>The line for wings forms in the archives with everything in the world.</p>
<p>After you snap them on fly down here where you can order a language.</p>
<p>Complexities in graspable units stabilizing the migrating flock</p>
<p>that is also writing which is the archive of language that is the archive</p>
<p>of the world, that is to say (again) of everything. Hi!</p>
<p>My relics reside in a series of cathedrals that resonate with each other.</p>
<p>Our musical project is to archive everything in a vault that performs</p>
<p>noninstitutional certainties and narrates our adventures in a style that</p>
<p>ignores differences caused by the disaffected or worse.</p>
<p>Pubic hair, lbarefoot, naked, lots and lots of pubic hair.</p>
<p>Everything dies so I won&rsquo;t have apocalypse with that. This is New York.</p>
<p>The apocalypse boring like mayonnaise in the 60s.</p>
<p>The young can&rsquo;t be left to their own devices because they will revert.</p>
<p>These wire cages are 100% plastic 50% of flesh und blood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truffle time at the Peccary Club.</p>
<p>Was writing your life got you on live? On Johnny Carson?</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the end of the seventh inning I was a hero! I escaped legally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses parted the water for the great El Duque. He stepped, he threw.</p>
<p>Instead of cringing in fear we used the occasion to applaud the baroque.</p>
<p>The dead studied us for flavor while we rehearsed our epitaphs.</p>
<p>I forget them now but they are brilliant collaborations with demons.</p>
<p>The lack of vigilance afforded us the opportunity to meet demons,</p>
<p>our fellow travelers whom we checked for bombs.</p>
<p>The end of the 20th century turned out to be my biography.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll call it Elvis.</p>
<p>There is no redundancy when everyone reads a book twice</p>
<p>but now we read parts of so many books they all seem redundant.</p>
<p>They opiate. Only oracular forays keep the minimalist standard.</p>
<p>Reality shook when Spock ordered sausage and was served penis.</p>
<p>Things were not going well on the Enterprise.</p>
<p>The Replicator was paraphrasing.</p>
<p>The first Art Brut show after the Velvet Revolution featured mushrooms</p>
<p>for visitors to sit on and watch 1968 Soviet tanks facing bare breasts.</p>
<p>The Fred and Ginger building hadn&rsquo;t yet been built but when it did</p>
<p>Ginger&rsquo;s head was a mushroom and Fred looked like a tank turret.</p>
<p>Friedrich Neitzsche is the reverse-Ikea of contemporary philosophy:</p>
<p>easy to take apart, impossible to put back together.</p>
<p>The reason he is alone now is that his name is hell to spell.</p>
<p>Unless&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;German,&nbsp;new&nbsp;philosophers&nbsp;are&nbsp;tired&nbsp;of&nbsp;googling.</p>
<p>Imagine&nbsp;if Jesus&nbsp;was&nbsp;named Grootan Ustashi.</p>
<p>The Ikea instruction booklet is written in cryptographic English.</p>
<p>Jesus was lucky with King James who hung all the bad translators.</p>
<p>The Bible is the Ikea of Christianity, more packed than Neitzsche.</p>
<p>I hate artificial intelligence because it changes every word</p>
<p>to fit into crap it learned from the Bible and Neitzsche.</p>
<p>AI has tastes of an Iowa MFA, an MIT PhD, and a Harvard MBA.</p>
<p>You can disagree but you have no choice: you must reread yourself .</p>
<p>Your freedom extends no farther than the menu.</p>
<p>You can order off the menu, it will be produced for you,</p>
<p>but you won't leave without paying or you'll be shot.</p>
<p>Judgements of value are luxuries the current gastro-market can't afford.</p>
<p>Aristotle said: &ldquo;everything is an exercise that erases its nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His name is easy to spell, what he just said not so much.</p>
<p>The silence of wilderness the strangeness of knowing people and words.</p>
<p>The heavens decreed that I should diversify at the expense of intimacy.</p>
<p>You need to have a rough childhood to have an interesting life.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a search engine but I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m searching for.</p>
<p>Finding anything will be difficult: in the future there will be only 3 of us</p>
<p>inching furtively past one another until we come to a great wall.</p>
<p>For now we are safe with translation, &ldquo;the most radical form of exile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jewish ghetto was razed when the Community House was built.</p>
<p>Time has too many houses: umbilical cord, Pobeda watch,</p>
<p>sex&nbsp;slaves&nbsp;in&nbsp;Rome,&nbsp;mother&rsquo;s&nbsp;wrist-watches,&nbsp;the&nbsp;coocoo&nbsp;clocks&nbsp;of&nbsp;Bavaria,</p>
<p>a&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;at&nbsp;4,&nbsp;the self-wrapping snake, plus now.</p>
<p>When you mix peasants with aristocracy to hear the simmer of kitsch.</p>
<p>A huge cloakroom holds the overcoats of the whole Czech bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Is this a Maltese falcon for use by a lesbian cult of noir?</p>
<p>We were sitting around the wrecked car Jesus</p>
<p>wouldn't let us examine until the police came with the Pharisees.</p>
<p>Jesus was partly in body and partly Coke machine. He needed quarters.</p>
<p>By the time I got the Coke Jesus had started the car.</p>
<div class="width:700px"><p>It&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;sound&nbsp;right&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;went&nbsp;to&nbsp;get&nbsp;John&nbsp;who&nbsp;got&nbsp;a&nbsp;wrench&nbsp;and&nbsp;looked&nbsp;under</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>the&nbsp;hood&nbsp;and&nbsp;said:&nbsp;&ldquo;We&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;laws&nbsp;of&nbsp;nature.&rdquo;&nbsp;He&nbsp;meant&nbsp;GM.</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>&nbsp;That&nbsp;night&nbsp;three&nbsp;women&nbsp;came&nbsp;to&nbsp;see&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;car&nbsp;was&nbsp;ready.&nbsp;One&nbsp;was&nbsp;a&nbsp;postage&nbsp;stamp.</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>There&nbsp;was&nbsp;a&nbsp;gradual&nbsp;erasure&nbsp;of&nbsp;difference.&nbsp;In&nbsp;the&nbsp;morning&nbsp;they&nbsp;were&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;each</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>others'&nbsp;bodies.&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;androgynous&nbsp;all&nbsp;day.&nbsp;I&nbsp;made&nbsp;a&nbsp;child&nbsp;version&nbsp;of&nbsp;spirit&nbsp;air</p></div>
<p>and that was the pancakes for breakfast.</p>
<p>My Indian friend from Guyana and was launching her first book</p>
<div class="width:700px">
<p>in&nbsp;English&nbsp;in&nbsp;New&nbsp;York,&nbsp;but&nbsp;her&nbsp;daddy&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;come&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;launch&nbsp;because&nbsp;he</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>was&nbsp;in&nbsp;Mecca&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;a&nbsp;flat&nbsp;black&nbsp;hat&nbsp;and&nbsp;was&nbsp;training&nbsp;birds&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;rajah</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>who&nbsp;needed&nbsp;them&nbsp;for&nbsp;his&nbsp;wedding.&nbsp;OK,&nbsp;daddy,&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;had&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;experience.</p></div>
<div class="width:700px"><p>I&nbsp;consoled&nbsp;her:&nbsp;"Your&nbsp;wit&nbsp;went&nbsp;to&nbsp;college&nbsp;before&nbsp;his&nbsp;brain&nbsp;went&nbsp;to kindergarten."</p></div>
<p>Jesus rose &amp; said: "The default make of my soul is joy. It's not natural."</p>
<p>The sadness of the fall from seems safe when operating a tear factory.</p>
<p>There is a market for these fears and accidents.</p>
<p>My brain is in its case and I'm home in my body like a popsicle</p>
<p>in the freezer even though my halo doesn't quite fit.</p>
<p>Can you call somebody? The treasure hunters are loose in the archives.</p>
<p>The vulgate names for reality were rarely written down.</p>
<p>Manners will be lost, and every side of an issue will be on display.</p>
<p>Synchronicity is symmetry in motion. Be sure if you draw that it moves.</p>
<p>I called for the price and got Richard Feyman himself on the phone.</p>
<p>It wasn't cheap, but I understood science. It all starts with a phone call.</p>
<p>The water whistler has nothing but his spout to lose.</p>
<p>Best place to hide is in a hammock woven from a tissue of lies.</p>
<p>You can also hide on Facebook where everybody who loves their face.</p>
<p>That's where efficient work of self-drowning is doomed to posterity.</p>
<p>I know you're tired of wisdom, so let's talk barley. I don't like it.</p>
<p>And check the weather. It always comes from the outside.</p>
<p>Rye bread is European misery, it must not ferment to become lysergic.</p>
<p>Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O'Keefe and Robert Frank met at Stieglitz'</p>
<p>where they met strangers who liked to draw, photograph, and gossip.</p>
<p>They forged bonds that translated into a dense currency market.</p>
<p>An archive of small souls was stashed in the cellar by Carpe Diems.</p>
<p>Freud was either as a conman or the founder of Deep Man</p>
<p>but nobody denies that he used needle-nosed pliers for dreams.</p>
<div class="width:700px">
<p>Don't&nbsp;be&nbsp;fooled&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;paper&nbsp;planes&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Vatican&nbsp;vending&nbsp;machines.</p></div>
<p>Birds&nbsp;of&nbsp;hubris fly overhead all the time. That&rsquo;s the Rome we love!</p>
<p>On Mount Athos you use a bucket &amp; a leaf. In St. Louis the evangelist</p>
<p>Dingo Smith experienced antimatter on pilgrimage to Epiphany, Mo.</p>
<p>Dingo Smith also experienced the divine in an Egyptian whorehouse</p>
<p>and five years later when he was a professor at Bob Jones University</p>
<p>he wrote a memoir: 'Effluvia and the Birth of the Spork."</p>
<div class="width:700px">
<p>The&nbsp;internet&nbsp;failed&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;up&nbsp;with&nbsp;itself&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;100&nbsp;or&nbsp;so&nbsp;people&nbsp;remaining&nbsp;on&nbsp;earth</p></div>
<p>had&nbsp;to&nbsp;bail&nbsp;it out by pretending to be many more.</p>
<div class="width:700px">
<p>There&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;minaret&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;dreams.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible&nbsp;for&nbsp;2&nbsp;wives,&nbsp;3&nbsp;cities,&nbsp;4&nbsp;countries,</p></div>
<p>5&nbsp;languages&nbsp;to dwell in one man's dreams?</p>
<p>Infante's Inferno began on the Yawning Heights.</p>
<p>This is a literary reference from the last century.</p>
<p>Nobody flushed Solzenitsyn down the toilet because he wrote</p>
<p>the fattest book nobody ever read, and also his beard caught on the seat.</p>
<p>Seven kilograms of pure book-meat and never finished by one reader!</p>
<p>A miracle! Ah, retired myths of let-be and deja-vu</p>
<div class="width:700px">
<p>with&nbsp;your&nbsp;2&nbsp;screens&nbsp;overhead,&nbsp;I&nbsp;heard&nbsp;your&nbsp;alien&nbsp;ships&nbsp;whence&nbsp;raspy&nbsp;laughter</p></div>
<p>came&nbsp;bouncing&nbsp;off the stars. In those days I checked</p>
<p>my tendency for the baroque religiously, like my blood-pressure,</p>
<p>which was mostly high, like I was, in my youth.</p>
<p>In Autumn I felt like being in cathedrals in Rome or Istanbul.</p>
<p>When you weren't even a seed there were the free boxes.</p>
<p>The tough ghosts in the samurai fairy tales collected taxes from the dead.</p>
<p>American museums evolved from freak shows, circuses, kunstcameras.</p>
<p>My many tattoos are an archive that will enter the lampshade market.</p>
<p>My body is authorized to tatoo itself whenever I don't give a shit.</p>
<p>I never forget and I never remember I never left and always got there.</p>
<p>The door-to-door salesman keeps ringing, has nothing to sell but we buy.</p>
<p>The unsolvable crossword puzzle of youth is in Italian.</p>
<p>The wasp nest in the eaves of the collapsing roof is a wobbly barque.</p>
<p>Inside a mirrored wine-cellar the placid lake beckons.</p>
<p>Humble rug-weavers use matchsticks and fruit loops for our living room.</p>
<p>I'll go into the morgue to ask Reverend where he keeps the voodoo dolls.</p>
<p>I know that you associate happiness with the smell of small engines.</p>
<p>The house of yawns is just over the hill. There we will fix dinner.</p>
<p>Leave the fingerprints on the doorknob and the potatoes in the ground.</p>
<p>This chicken is for laughs not yawns. It's an ashidoi, a mandarin duck.</p>
<p>It's like shards of God in bed watching TV and eating cookies.</p>
<p>Erect with affection I rise from the dead.</p>
