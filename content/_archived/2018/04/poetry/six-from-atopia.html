title: Six from Atopia
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speculative cobwebs embroidered with flowers<br>
back in the love garden of eternal truth, I am as unhurried 
as the smallest
creature left to revel in its own zigzag.</p>

<p>Take the fucking wine away! Its red center,<br>
the Saturns of my splendor and my emotional 
landscape is cured for a day or a daydream is turned 
into the vicious news cycle reeling in pain</p>

<p>Destroy my body, take away the wine and the drugs<br>
and the centers of my thinking 
so naked before you
Take away the music and the car and the job,
take away the riddle of my body</p>

<p>There is nothing mysterious to do here:<br>
I am just nipples and goosebumps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>The madness set in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as coral reefs bleached<br> 
This debt in my hands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will you take the rings? 
One word would set me off&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the dust murmurs 
of my own soul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rains barreling down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lifetime of traumas
&ldquo;I may not get better&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you  nature is violent and I am too 
What badness of men, miserable men&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the computer
was never going to solve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our strings, simple as corrugated dream 
Nothing practical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my iambs or slang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will save me from
the unnerving 666&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can you handle this?
Give me vitamins! Give me some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old operatic feelings 
like the long sequestered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loves I have shot into my chest </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Spring proliferation of rain and cops.<br>
National Weather Service alert.
What would they say 
If they knew I spent all day making a cake
shaped like a school bus from a 1970s
cookbook I found on a walk?
Passages of production. Touch them. </p>
<p>Sudden drop in the metallic temperature.<br>
Today, I&rsquo;m glad to be my salary. 
Forget me not.
There were so many services.
The department of homeland security
SUV I trailed from Tallahassee all 
the way to South Georgia turned off
a dirt road on Spring Hill. Whatever 
in the fuck? No way to know 
which hyper cosmic abyss they
sucked on, spit up. Fatal slope 
of magnolia blossoms  
inside the controlled burns. I look up 
from the abandoned Sunnyside 
Convenience Center parking lot,
a burnt palm leans against a wood
electricity pole and I&rsquo;m a monk. 
The drugstore here sold such cheap
elixirs once. I wish to spend
my life sealed off these structures of surveillance.</p>
<p>The lion or a grafted tree<br>
as a sign of fertility, I gazed upon the tenure 
of my feed where fake news doubled 
with espresso and the media
was like some sort of mediation 
we are all so famous now
we are all so famous 
that death is made ridiculous
look at you death, how ridiculous you are 
with your freakish body,
whoring yourself out like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>









<p>Inside&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encrypted eternity&nbsp;&nbsp; robots store my rosy data<br>
They say I have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healing powers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and this morning&nbsp;&nbsp; like a wave
I hail the glory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the jolie wolf&nbsp;&nbsp; the Irish Elk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depicted in the 19th
century&nbsp;&nbsp; lithography Oh kiss me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; believe in hell
other than the theory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Iceland&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my bathtub
which involves&nbsp;&nbsp; the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upper classes on vacation where
they don&rsquo;t have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to see or feel&nbsp;&nbsp; this lush C02 overgrowth&nbsp;&nbsp; the die offs</p>
<p>Goodbye, long-spined sea urchin&nbsp;&nbsp; washed up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in that glossy red tide<br>
I&rsquo;m on a tour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the magenta volcano&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that blows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; money and ash
the surface ice-slick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with both&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debt and credit&nbsp;&nbsp; In this epic&nbsp;&nbsp;
an industry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; springs up around&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the poet&nbsp;&nbsp; who has not been able to read
quietly in years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I confess I wanted things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be perfectly acute
and in that chrysalis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like nuclear energy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these worlds
shoved into containers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always exploded&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blood from the mouth and nose</p>
<p>I owe the library my sorcery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return the <em>Egyptian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Book of the Dead</em><br>
but I cannot eat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my abominations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under these palm trees
Happy is the corpse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the rain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rains on!
How these fronds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are so bewitching&nbsp;&nbsp; like Gregorian chants
but I know&nbsp;&nbsp; autumn comes despite monophonic grief&nbsp;&nbsp; on a boat
which also carries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red grains of beer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail, guardian of the door
I have made&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my offering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, give us peace</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>In dreams death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a passport&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transportation<br>
No River Styx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No coming or going&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No guide,&rdquo; I said
Not the light from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an open book&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a room of ancient libations
Nor the marble-vaulted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kropotkinskaia Metro Station&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the architecture
of the vernacular&nbsp;&nbsp; Not these preparations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the apocalypse
Oh falcon-headed god&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who guards the river&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that your tiny house
built on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge of the empire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with my ten dollar donation to</p>
<p>St. Francis Wildlife Association&nbsp;&nbsp; in exchange for eclipse glasses&nbsp;&nbsp; permafrost<br>
thawing on the sun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death is merely a body&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut in half by a machine:
sometimes a car&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or factory wheel, sometimes a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or cult
But mostly it is the body&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cut in half&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so much
we don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen killed by a Nazi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Charlottesville
on August 12, 2017&nbsp;&nbsp; the day I turn forty&nbsp;&nbsp; No blood in the spring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no blood on the shore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eclipse brought on&nbsp;&nbsp; my period
<p>There was a wolf&nbsp;&nbsp; at my door&nbsp;&nbsp; My father &nbsp;importer of exotic fruits<br>
I stripped off&nbsp;&nbsp; my tunic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renounced my income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protesters
were a wave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever birds&nbsp;&nbsp; land on your shoulders&nbsp;&nbsp; and you renounce
this mercantile life&nbsp;&nbsp; the shadows elongated&nbsp;&nbsp; the screen hurt my eyes
On the bank stood that lone&nbsp;&nbsp; Belted Kingfisher &nbsp;on the bank
of the vernacular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the flesh with a fish
glinting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in its beak&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please speak&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a piece of god</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>










<p>Permission slip signed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for kids to see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eclipse<br>
Now let us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monetize our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agonized sensorium
Don&rsquo;t drain yourself today&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of what you need
A sequence of scenes&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the beach
The beach is fake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made of salt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elderly people
line themselves&nbsp;&nbsp; to touch the salt cliffs&nbsp;&nbsp; with their naked
bodies as if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this were a shrine&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlotte gets a sunburn</p>
<p>in minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; passes out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hits her eye&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it swells<br>
she&rsquo;s still a toddler&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bunch of people gather around
a huge jewel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encrusted moth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flying in slow motion
by the salt cliff&nbsp;&nbsp; the moth lands on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hand of a woman
The sky fills with chickadees&nbsp;&nbsp; each one weighs&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 grams
People take their selfies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the dream moth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alongside
the dream sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the dream beach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the dream vermin</p>
<p>There is no future for us here&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will read this?<br>
It is not a climate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worth living in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I have brought children
into it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sacrificed nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not enough free time
to accomplish our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; political goals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I have gone online to read an article
interpreting what the moth means&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not good
I believe the interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s a scholarly paper
The chickadee and moth&nbsp;&nbsp; disintegrate before me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our lands jolie</p>
