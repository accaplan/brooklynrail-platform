<p>At one of his weekly salons, St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; is reported to have said: &ldquo;There is only one man who has the right to be an anarchist: me, the Poet, since I alone make a product that society does not want, in exchange for which it does not give me anything to live on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this bit of hearsay, I draw a negative definition of the poet&rsquo;s activity: that which society does not want. What it does want is not poetry, for society wants our interest in itself; it is self-interested. In such a society&mdash;where &ldquo;money alone wields power and therefore is the sole guarantee of truth&rdquo; (Julia Kristeva, &ldquo;The Revolt of Mallarm&eacute;&rdquo;)&mdash;it is unthinkable to provide for the poet whose subversive activity of &ldquo;pure expenditure&rdquo; calls into question the very basis of society&rsquo;s justice and ironizes its laws, for they cannot put poetry on trial.</p>
<p>Society would likely prefer us to tell our stories, so they may be subsumed and consumed, traded and sold&mdash;and our potential for change (thinking of Arendt and DuBois) along with them&mdash;in order to conjoin individual experience to its (so-called) grand narrative. (Mallarm&eacute; thought it his duty to fight the conspiracy to &ldquo;confine [literature] to daily chronicles.&rdquo;) Poetry, to paraphrase Anne Boyer&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;No,&rdquo; resides in a refusal of requirements: in turning away, it turns the world upside down: &ldquo;It is a no to the wretched arrangements of history and the greed-laminated earth&rdquo; (Boyer). The resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo; of Mallarm&eacute;&rsquo;s anarchism echoes for me in Amiri Baraka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black Dada Nihilismus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am of course aware of just how unfashionable, indeed how shameless, it is to be interested in literature, in poetry, above current affairs, and&mdash;in fact&mdash;it is that shamelessness that fuels my interest in one over the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just as well,&rdquo; Mallarm&eacute; wrote, &ldquo;for politics to get along without Literature and decide its fate with guns.&rdquo; He also said, &ldquo;I know of no bomb other than a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to certain recent demagoguery, I find it grounding to recall that Nicanor Parra, as long ago as the late 1940s, remarked, with an admirable lack of hesitation, that &ldquo;Truth, like beauty, is neither created nor lost / And poetry is in the things themselves.&rdquo; And in this I hear an echo of Mallarm&eacute;: &ldquo;Things already exist, we don&rsquo;t have to create them; we simply have to see their relationships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, in writing poetry, I too place my pen, in my own way, &ldquo;at the service of the Revolution,&rdquo; as Kropotkin asked us to do so long ago (&ldquo;Words of a Rebel,&rdquo; 1885). Otherwise, no one will know whether or not we wanted a perfect world.</p>
