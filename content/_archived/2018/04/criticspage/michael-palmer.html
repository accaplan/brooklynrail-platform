<p>It may not be obvious to all at first reading, but I cannot think of any of my writing of at least the last three decades that was not inflected by the shifting currents of &ldquo;the now.&rdquo; Nor can I think of any time in my writing life when the question, &ldquo;Why poetry?&rdquo; did not arise. Nor can I think of any time in my writing life when I could construe a satisfactory answer to that question, any answer that did not resort to nauseating platitudes or pious self-justification. As to &ldquo;the now,&rdquo; it is its very instability and undefinability that conjoin it with poetry, with poetry&rsquo;s potentiality, even as it is ever and again moved to reject the currency and authority of poetry itself.</p>
<p>Some years ago (2010), when I was the Visiting International Poet at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Bei Dao asked my wife and me whether we would care to visit Macao. We toured various sites dating from the Portuguese colonial occupation, including the mythic grotto where Luis de Cam&otilde;es, over several years, produced a number of cantos of his great epic <em>The Lusiads</em>. Then, all too soon, we found ourselves entering a towering casino by the port, shaped like a golden lotus. While Cathy and Bei Dao played the slots, I wandered around the large windowless space where neither day nor night ever reigned. The gambling tables and electronic games of chance emitted beeps and bells, and one occasionally heard the voice of a croupier. The phrase &ldquo;The world is<em> not</em> all that is the case&rdquo; came suddenly to mind, as I toured this otherworldly realm. I wondered whether Wittgenstein would have agreed. Was there any &ldquo;now&rdquo; in this environment ruled by (calculated) chance? Might a throw of the dice&hellip;?</p>
<p>We eventually departed, after my wife cashed in her modest winnings, and we walked toward the ferry to return to Hong Kong. Bei Dao suddenly pointed toward nearby mainland China (from which he was barred). &ldquo;Look, I could swim across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am attaching a poem from a few years ago that may be relevant to the questions Ann raises, even as it resolutely offers no answers:</p>

<p>Pain of the child set afire<br>
before blindered eyes
a world&rsquo;s eyes</p>

<p>Poem of the bird<br>
exploding in flight
in our random skies</p>

<p>Pain of the ladder<br>
its storm-shattered steps
defying ascent</p>

<p>Pain of the Hunger Moon<br>
dangling over hoar frost
by a failing thread</p>

<p>Should we cut it<br>
for those without bread
Pain of the word</p>

<p>Poem of the word<br>
unheard unread
The darkling river</p>

and the steadfast ferryman
who refuses your coin
The wave that embraces

<p>while it destroys<br>
Our secret entertainments
at the Madman&#146;s Market</p>

<p>and our alphabets without end<br>
that spell themselves
and weave themselves</p>

<p>into a trembling web<br>
as the poem-road below
of silences and stones</p>

<p>comes to a final turn</p>
<br>
