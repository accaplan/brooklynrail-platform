<p>April 6-8: <a href="https://withfriends.co/event/184703/ende_tymes_festival_9">Ende Tymes 9 Festival of Noise and Experimental Liberation at Silent Barn</a>. The mother of all noise music festivals will light up Bushwick as DIY hub Silent Barn hosts the ninth installment of the three day-long <a href="http://halfnormal.com/endetymes/">Ende Tymes</a>, Festival of Noise and Experimental Liberation. As the brainchild of Brooklyn-based extreme-music titan Bob Bellerue, Ende Tymes has endured while others have come and gone. Once again, Bellerue has assembled a monolithic lineup for noise, drone, industrial, and electronics heads to feast on and way too many to mention in this small space. This year&rsquo;s fest, however, will end on a bittersweet note as news broke recently that Silent Barn is shutting its doors on April 30.</p>
<p>April 7: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/196237320962952/">Ambient Church: Christina Vantzou's N&deg;4 Ensemble / Clarice Jensen at Bushwick United Methodist Church</a>. There might not be a more fitting venue than this 130-year-old Bushwick church for <a href="http://www.christinavantzou.com/">Christina Vantzou</a> to gently unfurl her cathartic tapestries of drone and mind-numbing and heaven-sent vocalizations. On the new, stunning <em>N&deg;4</em>, her fourth record, Vantzou crafts a transcendent fusion of ambient and classical music that is otherworldly and original in sound and vision. This evening, Vantzou is joined by an eight-piece ensemble featuring Steve Hauschildt, ACME String Quartet, Deradoorian, John Also Bennett (of Forma), and C. Lavender with visuals by Vantzou and Jonathan Turner and projection-mapped by Eric Epstein.</p>

<p>April 8: <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1651760?utm_medium=ampOfficialEvent&amp;utm_source=fbTfly">Experiments in Opera Family Reunion Benefit with Roddy Bottum &amp; Nastie Band, Glasser, Brian Chase &amp; Shelley Hirsch, Katiee, Nick Hallett &amp; Daisy Press, Dan Friel, Jessica Pavone at The Bell House</a>. The composer-driven Brooklyn-based opera company <a href="http://experimentsinopera.com/">Experiments in Opera</a> have been at the forefront of advancing new and adventurous ways of interpreting stage work to new and old audiences of all ages. At this daytime, family-friendly benefit, that freethinking range is showcased as Faith No More and Imperial Teen&rsquo;s Roddy Bottum headlines with ace improvisers Shelly Hirsch and Yeah Yeah Yeahs drummer Brian Chase teaming up while Jessica Pavone performs her viola wonders and ex-Parts &amp; Labor dude Dan Friel jabs cosmic electro-jazz tones from his Casio and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 10-14, 21: <a href="https://matafestival.org/mata-festival/2018-mata-festival/">MATA 20th Anniversary Festival 10-14 (The Kitchen, Chelsea) and 21 (Imagine Swimming, Tribeca)</a>. <a href="https://matafestival.org/">MATA</a> has long been a valuable platform for promoting and giving a voice to young composers and this month they celebrate their twentieth anniversary with a diverse showcase. Highlights include the East coast debut of Liminar, a new-music ensemble hailing from Mexico (on April 10 at The Kitchen) and immersive event A Room of One&rsquo;s Own: Nadia Botello&rsquo;s <em>Sono/Aqua</em> at Tribeca&rsquo;s Imagine Swimming, which closes out the festivities.</p>
<p>April 13: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/328297210990850/">Andrew Drury's Content Provider plays Greenwich House.</a> Drummer/composer <a href="https://andrewdrury.bandcamp.com/">Andrew Drury</a> has been a staple of the Brooklyn avant-jazz underground for years, hosting his Soup &amp; Sound house concert series while releasing a slew of recordings as both leader and sideman. Back in 2015, Drury debuted Content Provider, his quartet with the twin-sax assault duo Briggan Krauss and Ingrid Laubrock and guitarist Brandon Seabrook, to face-melting results. On <em>Try</em>, Content Provider&rsquo;s second effort, the heavy hitting Drury and company have upped the punk-jazz horsepower, swinging and slashing their way through marathon-length epics full of neck-snapping angularity, primal shrieking, conversational give and take, and all-out skronk madness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 14: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1093435080799669/">Music Against Mass Incarceration II at Trans-Pecos</a>. A worthy cause and arguably the generational crisis of our time, the second edition of Music Against Mass Incarceration unites a jaw-dropping lineup from across the spectrum that counts local trumpeter Jaimie Branch, Parquet Courts frontman A. Savage, avant-garde jazz visionary William Parker, sound designer and composer Lea Bertucci, and more as just a few who will be fighting the good fight tonight. Music is the healing force of the universe, indeed.&nbsp;</p>

With Tinariwen and <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/sidi-toure">Sidi Tour&eacute;</a> leading the way with their singular visions of spiritual bliss, the music emerging out of Mali reaches for the heavens. That will be on display over this three-day fest as the danceable energy, joyous vibes, and ecstatic and elastic grooves rhythms found on Tour&eacute;&rsquo;s new <em>Toubalbero</em> will fill the Williamsburg&rsquo;s Brooklyn Bowl.</p>

Julian Lage, Scott Colley &amp; Tom Rainey at (le) poisson rouge</a>. Composer, improviser, all-around guitar godhead, and longtime Brooklynite <a href="http://www.nelscline.com/">Nels Cline</a> follows up 2015&rsquo;s orchestral American Songbook &ldquo;mood music&rdquo; epic <em>Lovers</em> with its polar opposite<em>. Currents</em>, <em>Constellations</em>, the debut from The Nels Cline 4, finds the longtime Wilco member trading jazzy guitar licks galore with fellow six-string master Julian Lage in a loose-limbed&mdash;and fingered&mdash;swinging affair of breezy and delightfully intricate jams.</p>

<p>April 15: <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1643347?_ga=2.125238602.1792909412.1521578371-1956679070.1521578371&amp;__utma=1.1712177909.1521578371.1521578371.1521578371.1&amp;__utmb=1.1.10.1521578371&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1521578371.1.1.utmcsr=google%7Cut">RLYR and Fotocrime at Saint Vitus</a>.

Their forthcoming second effort titled <em>Actual Existence</em>, is a clenched fist-pumping, stadium-sized sprawl of ripped, anthemic riff-rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 17: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/russian-circles-elsewhere-hall-tickets-42134981865?_eboga=461331813.1521377310">Russian Circles and King Woman at Elsewhere</a>. The brainchild of singer/songwriter <a href="https://kingwoman.bandcamp.com/">Kristina Esfandiari</a>, King Woman&rsquo;s sludgy, doom-metal bludgeon is a moody, nightmarish, and apocalyptic beast. At times hellishly bleak and other times strange and beautiful, the combo of dripping feedback, slow burning riffs, and Esfandiari&rsquo;s breathy and haunting voice on 2017&rsquo;s <em>Created in the Image of Suffering </em>and their recent cover of The Stone Roses&rsquo; &ldquo;I Wanna Be Adored&rdquo; is a revelation in the broad metal pantheon.</p>

For a brief period in the 1950&rsquo;s, piano titan <a href="https://abdullahibrahim.co.za/">Abdullah Ibrahim</a> co-led bebop sensation The Jazz Epistles in tumult-ridden South Africa, taking their cues from American jazz while overcoming adversity to release the first modern jazz record made by an all-black group in that country. For this two-night stint, Ibrahim leads his group Ekaya with special guests as they pay homage to the righteous musical path and legacy that The Jazz Epistles rose up and left in the wake of apartheid and racism.</p>
<p>April 19: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gavinbrownsenterprise/">Blank Forms Presents Klein at Gavin Brown's enterprise</a>. Based in London, producer and electronics wunderkind <a href="https://klein1997.bandcamp.com/">Klein</a> churns out a weirdo, experimental hybrid of soul, R&amp;B, and hip-hop shapeshifting that sounds as if it&rsquo;s transmitted from another universe. Bursting at the seams with needle-skipping scratch, fragmented squeals, soulful whispers, and a spliced and diced array of found sounds (check out 2017&rsquo;s <em>Tommy</em>), Klein whips up a glitch-heavy sound-world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>April 20: <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1634989?utm_medium=ampOfficialEvent&amp;utm_source=fbTfly">The Messthetics, SAVAK and Sunwatchers at The Bell House</a>. Right off the proverbial bat, the locked-in bass/drums grooves, pounding thump and backbeat fury that was the foundation of every Fugazi record makes its welcome return on the eponymous debut of <a href="https://themessthetics.bandcamp.com/">The Messthetics</a>. A mini-Fugazi reunion of sorts, bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty join forces with D.C. avant-everything guitar hero Anthony Pirog on mosh pit-riling all-instrumental anthems that fuse razor-sharp post-punk rhythms with improvisational freak-outs.</p>

This fretboard-hurtling mayhem-themed night is further intensified by the Matt Hollenberg-piloted Shardik, whose self-titled jazzifed tech-metal workout from 2017 converged Flying Lutterbachers and Krallice-like precision. Tokyo punks Bo-Peep are Riot Grrl-influenced noiseniks whose influences run the gamut from grunge to Japanese peers Shonen Knife and Melt-Banana.</p>
