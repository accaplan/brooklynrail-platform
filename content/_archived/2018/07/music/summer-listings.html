<p>July 5: Anthony Coleman and Brian Chase Duo at <a href="https://www.aretevenue.com/">Arete Venue</a>. Percussionist Brian Chase holds down the backbeat for art-punks Yeah Yeah Yeahs, arguably the busiest improviser in town, has just launched his own record label, Chaikin Records. Chase lays out beats both bananas and scientific and tonight he will joust and jab with avant-garde improvisational veteran, virtuosic pianist Anthony Coleman.<br/>

<p>July 6: Mivos Quartet at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-lot-radio-other-people-present-patrick-higgins-dossier-record-release-tickets-46734854207?utm_source=Mivos+Press+List&amp;utm_campaign=c27dc72af8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_12_30_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_baacc0e765-c27dc72af8-421376705">San Damiano Mission</a>. Composer Patrick Higgins deconstructs classical structures and forms and then uses the parts to rebuild them into modern originals that bear some resemblance to the past while being absolutely futuristic. He&#1077;s releasing a new recording, <em>DOSSIER</em>, and the music will be in the expert hands of the Mivos players.</p>

<p>July 7: New Firmament Presents Sofie Herner + Nolan Throop, Andrew Smiley, Stevie May, Films of Miles Pflanz and DJ sets by Amy Mills + Guest at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/671224136553786/">The Footlight</a>. GRID drummer and New Firmament mastermind Nick Podgurski continues his left-field concert series with boy wonder guitarist Andrew Smiley. Formerly of punk-jazz unit Little Women and current cohort of Chris Pitsiokos and Will Mason, Smiley went solo last year with the skronked-out <em>Dispersal</em>, an otherworldly twenty seven-minute cosmic epic whose strings-bending brutality and cathartic chants nodded to Keiji Haino and Thurston Moore.<br/>

<p>July 7: The Body, BIG/BRAVE at <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1676491?_ga=2.56402153.330141453.1529843446-1965706494.1525641805">Saint Vitus</a>. The unsettling and forward thinking output of Portland&#1077;s The Body has defied all of metal&#1077;s conventions. They&#1077;ve deconstructed doom metal with deafening and warped shards of electronic, noise, and industrial music and on their most recent album, <em>I Have Fought Against It, But I Can&#1077;t Any Longer</em>, throbbing and claustrophobic techno-damaged hellscapes meet six-foot under screams and operatic wails on yet another noise-metal magnum opus.</p>

<p>July 8: Tara Jane O&#146;Neil and Marisa Anderson at <a href="https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1706530/tfly?utm_medium=458816&amp;skinName=tfly">Union Pool</a>. Guitarist Marisa Anderson&#1077;s fancy fretwork is cut from the Americana cloth as her Thrill Jockey Records label-mates Glenn Jones and Sarah Louise. Anderson&#1077;s finger-picking prowess on the new <em>Cloud Corner </em>is a travelogue of sorts, running the gamut from American primitive to classical to Tuareg style.<br/>

<p>July 9: Byron Westbrook, John Also Bennett at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/259503047954067/">Wonders of Nature</a>. The pulsating and serpentine vistas that sound artist and composer Byron Westbrook sculpts fry minds and confound senses. On his most recent stunning set, titled <em>Confluence Patterns</em>, Westbrook&#1077;s shapeshifting is in glitch-heightened and drone-heavy overload as he splatters gnarly psychedelia, contorted textures and patterns, and thwacking rhythms in its ecstatic sound-world.<br/>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6S_Z_-hjDM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></p>

<p>July 11: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/177647152860912/">Ron Anderson/Kevin Shea, Grex, Aaron Novik, Max Jaffe</a>. Hailing from Oakland&#1077;s vibrant avant underground is art-rock crew Grex. On their forthcoming record, <em>Electric Ghost Parade</em>, these Bay Area brainiacs trip out on a chilled-out yet complex attack of math-rock heroics, free-improvisational freak-outs, and psych-rock weirdness as they channel Henry Kaiser and Hendrix.</p>

<p>July 11: Middle Blue at <a href="http://calendar.barchordnyc.com/events/2018/7/11/middle-blue">Bar Chord</a>. Guitarist Brad Farberman is a shredder heavy on the funk action. As leader of the epically jamming crew Middle Blue, Faberman&#1077;s grooving <em>Love Chords</em> (released earlier this year) chugs and boogies like electric-Miles and Ornette Coleman &amp; Prime Time and vibes out on the deep spirituality of Alice Coltrane on a Parliament-Funkadelic kick.<br/>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2719374487/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3365324406/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://middleblue.bandcamp.com/album/love-chords">Love Chords by Middle Blue</a></iframe></p></p>

<p>July 13: Kenny Millions/Rat Bastard/Damon Smith Trio, Samantha Riott/Luke Stewart Duo, David Grollman Solo at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1608955515891027/">H0l0</a>. A pair of legendary sonic brutarians, saxophonist Kenny Millions and guitarist Rat Bastard join forces with double bass behemoth Damon Smith in what will surely be a raunch-filled evening of nihilistic fire music.<br/>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6O1axvd-Iqw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></p>

<p>July 15: Matt Parker at <a href="http://www.mattparkermusic.com">A.R.T./New York South Oxford Space</a>. Saxophonist Parker&#1077;s sophomore album, <em>Present Time</em>, showed a gentle and imaginative way with standard jazz language. It left a subtle but lasting effect. He&#1077;ll be appearing with pianist Max Farber, a long-time collaborator, playing music out of the Great American Songbook&#151; Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Glen Miller, Harry Connick Jr., George Gershwin. Cool music for the summer nights.</p>

<p>July 15: En Orbita with Os Mutantes, Martin Rev, Lee Ranaldo Trio, A Place To Bury Strangers, Yonatan Gat, Land In The Sky, Breaking Forms at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/en-orbita-with-os-mutantes-martin-rev-lee-ranaldo-trio-a-place-to-bury-strangers-yonatan-gat-land-tickets-47231092469?aff=efbeventtix">(le) poisson rouge</a>. The Chile-based En Orbita festival&#1077;s mission statement is described as &#1074;a dialogue between science and&#8230;how music connects across spaces, cultures, and potentially dimensions.&#1075; That dimension reaches far across a range of spectrums of sound as the third edition of the festival presents Tropicalia pioneers Os Mutantes alongside NYC&#1077;s own Martin Rev (of Suicide), Sonic Youth cofounder Lee Ranaldo, post-punk trio A Place To Bury Strangers, and surf-psych-free-improv guitarist, Yonatan Gat. </p>

<p>July 17&#8211;21: Matt Hollenberg Residency at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1683984775024496/">The Stone at New School</a>. Matt Hollenberg is an avant-metal guitar overlord whose dizzying, pinpoint-precise finger work melds a lethal hybrid of technical metal, free jazz, death metal, and downtown skronk. For his Stone residency, all that will be showcased as Hollenberg will melt faces with Cleric, Shardik, his Quartet with fellow guitarist Nick Millevoi, and iNFiNiEN.<br/>

<p>July 19: Vernon Reid, Suphala, Tim Motzer, and Gintas Janusonis at <a href="http://www.aretevenue.com">Aret&#142; Venue and Gallery</a>. Unpredicatability in music is outlined by a lack of definition. For example, how would you describe a quartet of guitarists Reid and Motzer, tablaist Suphala and drummer Janusonius? The only way to figure it out is to go see this absolutely unique collaboration in the intimate Aret&#142; space.</p>

<p>July 20&#8211;21: Sonic Arts Union at <a href="http://issueproject.org">ISSUE Project Room</a>. Seven pioneering experimental collective Sonic Arts Union are commemorated over a two-night run highlighted by the world premiere of Alvin Lucier&#1077;s <em>Double Helix</em> for four guitars, his second ever piece written exclusively for the instrument. The piece is set to be performed by composer and multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi and Stephen O&#8217;Malley of doom-metal legends, Sunn O)))). </p>

<p>July 20: Forma (Record Release), Ka Baird, Jen Monroe at <a href="https://nationalsawdust.org/event/adhoc-presents-forma/">National Sawdust</a>. Brooklyn-based electronics trio Forma celebrate the release of the hypnotic, catchy, and swirling <em>Semblance</em>, a futuristic groundswell of blip and bleeps and polyrhythmic chug that draws from Kraut-rock, minimalism and ambient music.<br/>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2925280547/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://formasounds.bandcamp.com/album/semblance">Semblance by Forma</a></iframe></p></p>

<p>July 22: ONO, Taiwan Housing Project, BLOOR, Samantha Riott at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/378083059349553/">The Glove</a>. Chicago underground legends ONO been shelling out their self-proclaimed gospel-noise for over three decades now. Seminal records like <em>Albino</em> and <em>Diegesis</em> shattered the noise, funk, jazz, art-rock, and post-rock blueprint and are classification-defying must-haves for your record collection. Completing this monster bill are noise-punks Taiwan Housing Project, free jazz locals BLOOR, and no wave-inspired spoken word firebreather and Rodenticide leader Samantha Riott, who is prepping <em>Bloodletting</em>, her upcoming solo album via her own The Fifth House imprint. </p>

<p>July 23: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/231911640875784/">Bushwick Improvised Music Series</a>: Overishins (Mick Barr, Chuck Bettis, Mike Pride, Johnny DeBlase), Marc Edwards &amp; Slipstream Time Travel, Gauci/Ewen/Lane and more.

Tonight, Edwards leads his own ensemble, Slipstream Time Travel, as they ascend to the spiritual-jazz heights of Sun Ra, Sonny Sharrock, and Albert Ayler.<br/>

This Is Not This Heat is the cleverly-named offshoot project comprised of the surviving members of U.K. experimental legends This Heat, Charles Bullen and Charles Hayward. The duo recently rebooted This Heat and in its current incarnation, they are continuing their avant-everything deconstruction.</p>

<p>July 27: Go: Organic Orchestra and Brooklyn Raga Massive at <a href="http://rubinmuseum.org/events/event/future-go-organic-orchestra-and-brooklyn-raga-massive-07-27-2018">Rubin Museum</a>. Adam Rudolph&#1077;s orchestra of the future and Raga Massive&#151;a modern music ensemble that channels their ideas through traditional Indian music&#1072;will combine techniques and spirits into something that may succeed where Ginsberg failed, levitating the Rubin Museum.</p>

<p>July 27: <a href="https://www.bricartsmedia.org/events-performances/bric-celebrate-brooklyn-festival/tinariwen-cheick-hamala-diabate">BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn Festival</a> Presents Tinariwen. Purveyors of sprawling desert-rock jams, Tuareg guitar gods Tinariwen have become a sensation in these parts since emerging from their Mali homeland. Their trance-rock, made up of roiling guitarscapes and ritualistic chanting, is a mesmerizing beast, and outside at Prospect Park, it should be a magical experience that is a summertime must-see.<br/>

<p>July 28: Jenny Q Chai at <a href="http://www.spectrumnyc.com">Spectrum</a>. Pianist Chai has a new performance program she calls Sonorous Brushes, and after opening it in London she&#8217;s bringing it to the new Spectrum space across from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Sonorous connects the old&#151;Debussy, Ravel, and Messiaen&#151;with new works from Jaroslaw Kapuscinski that combine music with visuals, via the Antescofo sofware that synchronizes visuals with audio in real-time.</p>

<p>July 28: String Orchestra of Brooklyn at <a href="https://squareup.com/store/the-string-orchestra-of-brooklyn/item/adams-gorecki-wolfe">St. Ann Holy Trinity Church</a>.

In May, the local new-music community suffered an immeasurable loss when composer and musician Matt Marks tragically passed away.

Art-punk institution Pere Ubu remain a hugely influential band with classic records like <em>The Modern Dance</em> and <em>Dub Housing </em>still resonating today. However, vocalist David Thomas and company refuse to do the nostalgia tours. Pere Ubu are still putting out new albums full of their trademark quirk and nervous energy (like last year&#1077;s <em>20 Years in a Montana Missile Silo</em>) and a tour circuit staple. Tonight, they help LPR ring in their ten-year anniversary. </p>

<p>August 26: Music Against Mass Incarceration III at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/music-against-mass-incarceration-w-guerilla-toss-sunwatchers-kyp-malone-tickets-47195119874">Secret Project Robot</a>.
