<p class="artseen-info">Moers, Germany | MAY 18 - 21, 2018</p>
<p>Following the inspired-as-ever 2016 Moers Festival, there was a&nbsp;worrying period where it looked like this deeply entrenched&nbsp;alternative German institution would suffer a sudden death. Its&nbsp;artistic director for just over a decade was Reiner Michalke (he&nbsp;runs the equally alternative venue Stadtgarten in Cologne). After&nbsp;the 2016 edition, Michalke was locking horns with the newly-elected&nbsp;local politicians over cash and compromises, the usual bad shit.&nbsp;He quit twice. Perhaps realizing that the small German city of&nbsp;Moers had grown quite an international reputation as the home of&nbsp;such a vanguard festival, and the fact that the event was deeply&nbsp;rooted in the surprisingly radical local community&rsquo;s psyche, the&nbsp;2017 edition went ahead, largely following the style established by&nbsp;Michalke. A new team entered the fray, new artistic&nbsp;director Tim Isfort being both a sympathetic musician and a local&nbsp;resident, raised in Moers.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s festival had a low international profile, but in 2018,&nbsp;it is now exuding a palpable strength of renewal, an expansion and&nbsp;confidence that continues to present a heady line-up of performers&nbsp;that could be said to loosely spring from the jazz world, although&nbsp;mostly hailing from its more unusual nooks. As with the&nbsp;fest-of-old, there are many acts that lurk in the spheres of rock&nbsp;and electronic music, and no shortage of players who are committed&nbsp;to completely free improvisation. Back when it started, in 1971,&nbsp;the Moers Festival was more directly intent on free jazz as its&nbsp;core, and in 2018 it&rsquo;s still fundamentally following that trail of&nbsp;unshackled invention. Now, though, fresh generations are applying&nbsp;similar attitudes, but with different instrumentations, and altered&nbsp;genre forms.</p>
<p>Your scribe&rsquo;s first attendance of the Moers Festival was for the&nbsp;final year inside its traditional circus tent (2013). Following&nbsp;this, there was a move indoors to a specially constructed hall,&nbsp;where most of the core program is still presented. The old&nbsp;concept of the extended outdoor surrounding free festival has been&nbsp;intensified in 2018, with many more sets being played on stages&nbsp;around the local parkland. There has also been a spread into the&nbsp;actual city of Moers, a couple of miles away, but the reality of&nbsp;being in the central field is that there are so many crucial sets&nbsp;happening around the main Halle that such diversions can prove&nbsp;risky, in terms of losing valuable transfer time. The best strategy&nbsp;was to remain in the Halle, or saunter out to the nearby&nbsp;Festivaldorf open air stage, and still get to greedily consume most&nbsp;of the prime bands.</p>
<p>Talibam! opened and closed the long weekend, also providing&nbsp;conceptualized sets over the middle days, as the duo-in-residence,&nbsp;augmented in novel ways. The core twosome of Matt Mottel (keytar)&nbsp;and Kevin Shea (drums) were joined by saxophonist Matt Nelson and&nbsp;pianist Ron Stabinsky, the opening set&rsquo;s Hard Vibe band generating&nbsp;what amounted to a systems music version of a 1960s organ groove&nbsp;number, repeatedly swooping up to next-stage climaxes, Nelson&nbsp;rarely letting up in his streaming solo passages, as the general&nbsp;suspended funkiness pulsed onwards. Hard Vibe performed in the&nbsp;dark, until a midpoint shift cued a sudden burst of strobing&nbsp;flashes, before the old blackness resumed. This was apparently a&nbsp;strategic choice requested by Isfort and company, the first of many&nbsp;personalized touches littered across the weekend&mdash;inflatable sharks&nbsp;with whirring tail-fins were led around on long string leads by&nbsp;the fest-staff, as if they were perambulating their poodles. A&nbsp;table of strawberries mysteriously appeared. There was a Sunday&nbsp;infestation of garden gnomes, both inside and outside the&nbsp;Halle.</p>
<p>And seconds after Hard Vibe slammed to a halt, the second stage&nbsp;erupted into life with a rabid attack by CP Unit, led by NYC&nbsp;altoman Chris Pitsiokos. This was a radically jolting way to unveil&nbsp;a stage&mdash;if the audience hadn&rsquo;t noticed its existence&mdash;situated in&nbsp;the dark, on the dividing line between flat seating and raised&nbsp;chair-ranks. CP Unit hit hard, their leader hyperventilating above&nbsp;(and against, and aligned with) electric guitar and bass, shooting&nbsp;out hard, tight jets of percussive solo notes, careening amongst&nbsp;jagged riff contortions, complex and accelerated. John Zorn&nbsp;comparisons are tough to avoid.</p>

<p>Nate Wooley&rsquo;s <em>Seven Storey Mountain</em> seemingly exists in an&nbsp;ongoing state over the last few years, with various parts&nbsp;performed by varying-size ensembles. The Moers manifestation must&nbsp;surely be its fullest expression so far, with an expanded cast of&nbsp;players, and an epic scaling of sonic masses, from subtle&nbsp;post-colliery brass up to majestic drone colorations. It nodded to&nbsp;Colin Stetson and Phill Niblock, and perhaps Faust and The Velvet&nbsp;Underground, or, oddly, Merzbow and Arvo P&auml;rt. Ultimately, it is&nbsp;wild Wooley. The composer woved together the layerings of the massed&nbsp;players, who included C. Spencer Yeh, Samara Lubelski (heavily&nbsp;amped violins), and Ryan Sawyer (drums), with a host of European&nbsp;guests on vibraphones, guitar, reeds, plus a large brass battalion,&nbsp;the latter setting the scene in the beginning then promptly filing off&nbsp;after making their fanfare statement.</p>
<p>The soundscape soon became skeletal, populated by long tones and&nbsp;decaying bells with isolated thunderings. A cumulative, hovering&nbsp;drone was layered with scuffed, abrasive details, Lubelski rising&nbsp;to prominence, doubled drums adding to the composite thrum. The&nbsp;brass returned to create a tumbling wave-crashing, and the illusion&nbsp;of voices was created via commingled accumulation. Was much of the&nbsp;vocalizing emerging from Wooley&rsquo;s throat? His aim was surely to&nbsp;build a oneness of sound, where individuals become inextricable&nbsp;parts. The full blow-out arrived, as Wooley took his microphone off&nbsp;its stand, plunging it into his trumpet, and then leaning his head&nbsp;back, instrument aloft, for the final crescendo sustain, heavens&nbsp;cowering above.</p>
<p>The itinerant Chicago trumpeter Rob Mazurek runs several versions&nbsp;of his Chicago Underground, whose absolute core consists of himself&nbsp;and drummer Chad Taylor. For Moers, Mazurek brought along the&nbsp;London twinning, with Alexander Hawkins (piano) and John Edwards&nbsp;(bass). They opened up on the last afternoon, demonstrating how to&nbsp;begin the indoor dark-day with a huge heft of concentrated energy.&nbsp;Mazurek and company had been limbering up during the previous&nbsp;late-night improvising Moers Session, and their actual official&nbsp;appearance continued the festival&rsquo;s presumably unplanned sequence&nbsp;of &lsquo;ritualistic&rsquo; performance. Mazurek stuck to piccolo trumpet&nbsp;throughout, peppering the set with projectile extremity, operating&nbsp;at ultra-precise levels, and displaying a certain stamina for the&nbsp;piercing note scattershot. He downed the horn a few times, to shake his&nbsp;Brazilian-style Candombl&eacute; cluster of cowbells, sometimes slamming&nbsp;them hard on the stage-floor, vocalizing with an invocatory cry.&nbsp;Hawkins and Edwards already possess a significantly explosive&nbsp;rapport, but this was spread into a vibrating canopy over the two&nbsp;Americans. Taylor engaged all with his full-on torrent, but also&nbsp;cooled down on the electrified mbira thumb-piano, as the piece moved though its varied phases. It was seamless, but also frustratingly brief: either the Chicago/London Underground were only allotted a short spell, or their sounds were so involving&nbsp;that the show sped by with the uncanny time compression of heavy&nbsp;joy.</p>
<p>Talibam! returned to the Halle for the closing set on the last night. Big Impakt&nbsp;corralled (barely) most of the drummers who had been playing&nbsp;throughout the festival, ranging them across the large stage in a&nbsp;majestic battalion of (semi) organized thunder (with a strange sort&nbsp;of subtlety being an occasional option). Rarely has such a total&nbsp;blow-out performance concluded a festival. Kevin Shea led from his&nbsp;drum electro-pads, the only drummer without a kit, coaxing on a&nbsp;stick&rsquo;n&rsquo;skins ensemble that included Taylor, Christian&nbsp;Lillinger and Tcheser Holmes.</p>
<p>Ron Stabinsky had undergone a remarkable transmogrification into a&nbsp;death metal emcee, dashing out from the wings, locks flowing, on&nbsp;repeated occasions to hold up coded prompts for the drummers, then chundering into the vocal microphone alongside Shea. Turning around, your scribe suddenly&nbsp;noticed that Mottel had the secondary stage all to himself, as he too prompted switchings of mass potential within the ranks. As Big Impakt careened and rumbled to its conclusion,&nbsp;Mottel strode from mid-stage to front-stage, stepping from bench to&nbsp;bench, as he made his inevitable progress towards complete and&nbsp;united cacophony, clambering up to combine with the core. The Moers&nbsp;Festival closed with awe-striking frenzy, delivering its biggest&nbsp;communal ritual of the long holiday weekend.</p>
