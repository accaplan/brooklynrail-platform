<p>In January of 1975, at the Open Mind Gallery on Greene Street, ArtistsTalkOnArt &reg;, then a new artist-run art talk series held its first of more than 1,000 panels and programs (which continue to this day) with one of its founding board members, Irving Sandler, in attendance.</p>
<p>ArtistsTalkOnArt was conceived the Summer of 1974 by three co-founders: Lori Antonacci, a multimedia artist, Doug Sheer, a painter and video artist, and Bob Wiegand, also a painter and video artist. We then set about assembling steering and programming committees that included Bruce Barton, Corinne Robins, Cynthia Navaretta, and Irving Sandler. When we got around to incorporating several years later, the seven of us became the first official board of directors.</p>
<p>ArtistsTalkOnArt took its initial inspiration from the (Artists&rsquo;) Club, which started in 1949 and ran into the early 1960s. While the two of us were too young to have participated, the rest of our team had. Bruce had been a member. Cynthia, who could not be a member because she was a woman, attended as a &ldquo;guest.&rdquo; Bob had done a stint as its &ldquo;doorman&rdquo; and had shown in Tenth Street Galleries. Irving had not only attended and participated but had served as its program organizer from 1959 to 1962.</p>
<p>However, ArtistsTalkOnArt was very different from the Club. Whereas the Club had operated (however loosely) like a private, exclusive membership organization, ArtistsTalkOnArt was designed to be inclusive, egalitarian, and pluralistic. Any artist could suggest a topic, and once vetted by a program committee of artists, was given carte-blanche to organize and present. All staff and presenters agreed to work and participate for free (augmented by an occasional grant). The admission fee was kept low, initially $1.00 and everyone paid the same. The evening started with coffee and often ended with a spirited, audience-participation debate.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason why Irving accepted our invitation to join the board, and continued as an active board member, sometimes panel organizer and moderator, and then valued advisor, until his death.</p>
<p>ArtistsTalkOnArt fit right in with Irving&rsquo;s well-known openness to new artists and his democratic embrace of new styles and movements. As he has said, &ldquo;Wanting to learn as much as I could, I found out where the artists met and used to hang out there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the art community grew and encompassed new styles, ArtistsTalkOnArt provided Irving with the perfect place to &ldquo;hang out,&rdquo; a focal point where artists representing every genre and art movement of the 1970s and beyond came to talk, debate, and formulate new ideas.</p>
<p>Which is why, on many a panel evening, you could find Irving seated off to one side, listening intently, notebook and pen in hand.</p>
<p>While Navaretta brought us deep feminist art world connections and Barton was on a first-name basis with &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; Robins was seen the new gal on the critic/curator block, and Sandler was from the onset seen as the &ldquo;grand master&rdquo; of the art world. He exuded the seriousness of a college professor yet treated us as equals, and was willing to share his connections to the Abstract Expressionists and New York School artists who became our first cohort of talkers. Among those who appeared on our panels were Peter Agostini, Nell Blaine, Herman Cherry, Ed Clark, Dorothy Dehner, James Gahagan, Michael Goldberg, Grace Hartigan, Budd Hopkins, Leonard Horowitz, John Hultberg, Buffie Johnson, Wolf Kahn, Bill King, Ruth Kligman, Marisol, Mercedes Matter, George McNeil, Alice Neel, Pat Passlof, Philip Pavia, Milton Resnick, Larry Rivers, Sal Romano, Jane Wilson and Athos Zacharias.</p>
<p>Besides lending his guidance and advice, Irving also organized and moderated several early panels including: &ldquo;Questions of Size and Scale&rdquo; with Ruth Abrams, Judith Bernstein, Natvar Bhavsar, Suzanne Harris, Pat Lasch, and Judy Seigel (March 1978); and &ldquo;What Artists Want from Critics/ What Critics Expect from Criticism and from Artists&rdquo; featuring Leon Golub, Philip Pearlstein, Jeff Perrone, Deborah Remington, Corinne Robins, and Barbara Zucker (November 1978).</p>
<p>In the Winter of 1979, he helped organize a series of color and pattern panels, moderating one, &ldquo;Color as Painting,&rdquo; with Frances Barth, Natvar Bhavsar, Virginia Cuppaidge, and Robert Swain. In 1983, he led Hilton Kramer, Donald Kuspit, Barbara Rose, and Ingrid Sischy in talking about &ldquo;Art and Art Criticism: Criteria for the &rsquo;80s.&rdquo; There were many more.</p>
<p>ArtistsTalkOnArt differed from the Club in one other important aspect. We documented everything, first by audio then video. So, when we began a campaign to find a home for our growing archive of documents plus more than 1,000 digitized audio and video recordings, Irving once again lent his expertise and connections.</p>
<p>He wrote letters of introduction, cajoled museum contacts to meet with us, and let the world know, &ldquo;Beginning with members of the New York School and working its way through virtually every movement since then, ArtistsTalkOnArt has created a unique oral history of contemporary art.&rdquo; He was also the first to congratulate us when we successfully placed the entire 1974 &ndash; 2016 archive with the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>Today, ArtistsTalkOnArt is the art world&rsquo;s longest-running and most prolific aesthetic panel discussion series. We are now programming the 43rd Fall Season at the National Arts Club. It continues to be artist-run and a place where artists can share ideas and debate theories with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our favorite Irving quote sums it up perfectly, &ldquo;I have found the most interesting and lively ideas about art were and are generated within artist circles, within artists&rsquo; talk.&rdquo; And we honor Irving for helping us to create and sustain that with ArtistsTalkOnArt.</p>
