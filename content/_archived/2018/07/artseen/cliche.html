<p>According to the rationale behind the summer group exhibition <em>Cliche</em>, finding a painting that doesn&rsquo;t fall into the pattern of one clich&eacute; or another is about as easy as finding a needle in a haystack. This cheerful and overstuffed show&mdash;with 43 artists in all&mdash;strives to find a thought-provoking and elastic catch-all for the prodigious number of styles and subjects of its chosen participants. Curator Bill Powers&rsquo;s definition of clich&eacute; is therefore a bit lax, and many of the categories of clich&eacute; around which pieces are grouped are esoteric, tongue-in-cheek, or otherwise inscrutable. (So much so that a detailed list and map are provided.)</p>!!img2!!
<p>While some works are images or forms that exult in their banality and predictability&mdash;such as Sally Saul&rsquo;s silly sweet clay dog portraits <em>Black Dog</em>, <em>Dog with Bone</em>, and <em>Little Dog</em> (all 2018), Josh Smith&rsquo;s oil on canvas <em>Untitled</em> (2015), a classic Memento Mori, and a riff on Van Gogh&rsquo;s famous smoking skeleton, or Genieve Figgis&rsquo;s gooey painting <em>Under the Rainbow</em> (2018), in which thick paints bleed and swirl into each other&mdash;not all elicit a resigned sigh or guilty smile as we acknowledge a tired (or tried-and-true) visual trope engineered to eke out a sensation of happiness, comfort, or self-reflection. Other subjects and compositions simply don&rsquo;t fit this definition of clich&eacute;, and Powers has roped in some very expansive genres of visual representation: Would we call a short story, a sonnet, or an epic poem a clich&eacute; in literature? It feels overly simplistic to accuse traditional formats like portraits, self-portraits, landscapes, and nudes of being inherently clich&eacute;d, as Powers has done in several of his selections&mdash;these are just too open-ended and accommodating of variety. It was also necessary to consult the exhibition guide while wandering through the galleries in order to fathom the nuance of clich&eacute; playing out among what appeared to be a random selection of paintings by sometimes recognizable contemporary artists. Some works, such as Richard Prince&rsquo;s cheery smiley face <em>Untitled (Kool-Aid)</em> (2011), clearly fit within their clich&eacute; category, but others were impossible to ascertain. (I could not tell, for example, that Shara Hughes&rsquo;s <em>One Last Step </em>(2017), a stained-glass-like psychedelic view onto a copse of trees, fell into the genre of &ldquo;window.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>!!img3!!
<p>The pejorative sense of the term clich&eacute; also gets whitewashed in this exhibition. One should, ostensibly, loathe the experience of enduring an onslaught of hackneyed and trite images. This is overwhelmingly <em>not</em> the sensation one has viewing George Condo&rsquo;s <em>Name Composition</em> (1989), a painting that presents the timeless arts &amp; crafts activity of rendering one&rsquo;s own name in elaborate, usually puffy lettering. Except for those with children aged five to eleven, this comes as a refreshing alternative to the deeply symbolic or abstract imagery with which we are usually faced in our art-world perambulations. Is a clich&eacute; still a clich&eacute; if it comes as a welcome change? The same question holds for Albert Oehlen&rsquo;s <em>untitled</em> (2013), which the gallery describes as an example of &ldquo;finger painting.&rdquo; The curator seems to conflate clich&eacute; with <em>art world</em><em>clich&eacute;</em>. Perhaps I, as an artist and art writer, have to contend with Renoir&rsquo;s, Degas&rsquo;s, and Picasso&rsquo;s &ldquo;bathers&rdquo; regularly, but most viewers wouldn&rsquo;t shudder at the sight of Cy Gavin&rsquo;s gritty and richly textured <em>Bather III</em> (2018). Nor would one ever really grow weary of images of lightbulbs&mdash;another subheading of clich&eacute;d painting identified by Powers&mdash;such as Al Freeman&rsquo;s nod to Claes Oldenburg, and Coosje Van Bruggen <em>Soft Lightbulb with Yellow Cord</em> (2018).</p>!!img4!!
<p>In this sense, the exhibition had the positive, and perhaps unintentional, effect of demanding that one leave one&rsquo;s overwrought art-world assumptions at the door in order to appreciate the full taxonomy of subjects that can be depicted&mdash;subjects to which we often have become so habituated, we no longer register the psycho/socio buttons that the images are pushing in our collective psyche. Some works succeeded in both falling into a very typical category while also containing a kernel of the unexpected: Mark Grotjahn&rsquo;s exuberant depiction of a skull, for example, <em>Untitled (Skull XXIV 48:50)</em> (2016) <strong>is </strong> a painting of an object &ldquo;officially sanctioned&rdquo; as one worthy of representation going back to D&uuml;rer, Holbein, and well before that. Elizabeth Peyton&rsquo;s <em>Queen Elizabeth aged 16</em> (1997) and Sam McKinnis&rsquo;s <em>Prince George &amp; Prince William</em> (2018), are examples of the &ldquo;British Royal family&rdquo; (as the exhibition notes) or the wider clich&eacute; of aristocratic portraiture. And looking at Cynthia Talmadge&rsquo;s flickering pastel pointillist <em>Bath Salts Part 2</em> (2018) reminded me how short-lived pointillism was. However, it is Rene Ricard who, with a single work, questions both the value and arbitrariness of categorization&mdash;in a universal sense, the central theme the exhibition plays with: how clich&eacute;s form categories that are repeated so often that we feel we already know what is coming. Filed under &ldquo;religious art,&rdquo; which seemed quite accurate, is the initially confusing drawing <em>Cross Dressing (Purple)</em> (1989). It is simply a handwritten list: &ldquo;3 spikes, 1 loin cloth, and a simple crown of thorns.&rdquo;</p>
