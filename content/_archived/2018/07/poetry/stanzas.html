title: Stanzas from an untitled poem
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And her<br>
red-eyed captain
won&#146;t knock off at night. My 
handkerchief may be the only person
looking</p>
<p>after<br>
her. She dipped it
in her glass with a bashful
sort of contempt: <em>Here, sir</em>, holding 
the wet </p>
<p>corner<br>
to me, <em>what&#146;s that
for</em>? said she. Threats cannot move
her. The stars look as though they can&#146;t 
stand each</p>
<p>other<br>
yet want to suck 
each other off. They have 
that nasty, rotten quality
some folks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like in<br>
their sex star&mdash;a
virtual mondegreen of
&ldquo;who&#146;d borrow a kid&rdquo; and the
night rate.</p>
<p>Plus, the<br>
gathering crowd 
would dissemble with them&mdash;they
stand on stools to gape, a people
I don&#146;t</p>
<p>know much<br>
about, the strange
children would fail and be
afraid out of their prisons and
succumb.</p>
<p>Every<br>
day they wind their 
funnels open and shut
until finally they overwind
them right</p>
<p>into <br>
October. As
they do they become
monosyllabic, like forest
rangers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>putting<br>
on that look of
wholesome obscenity.
Yeah, they&#146;re creeps, juicy pieces of 
eating</p>
<p>stuff in<br>
their prime, but don&#146;t
worry, we won&#146;t make you 
do things you don&#146;t want to. And we
have some</p>
<p>new meds<br>
to keep it safe: 
<em>blood-boilers</em>. I gave him
a taste, just a wee little dab&mdash;
why, sir,</p>
<p>it&#146;s your<br>
eye that worries
me&mdash;it&#146;s big as a door!
(And don&#146;t go round counting people, 
they can</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tell when<br>
you&#146;re doing that. 
He hands me a list of
Latin secrets from the sick
barrack</p>
<p>and says,<br>
You can&#146;t be yelled
at by a tree&mdash;under
it, yes, but the tree can&#146;t help it.
Oh, peek-</p>
<p>a-boo<br>
heart what would I 
trade you for? Moldy clothes
for seven planks? The reason I&#146;m 
shy of </p>
<p>objects<br>
is because I
like them. Old tools and such.
Come on in here where we can get
it good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
