<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>after Denise Riley</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there is still profit to be made from none,<br>
Then I who will tread lightly</p>
<p>On my own head without realizing<br>
And you who will empty out money from</p>
<p>Form without caring or realizing and<br>
I who go about my day</p>
<p>Beating down like a sun or a factory, <br>
Without knowing or caring or realizing. </p>
<p>And so we do, and we go about<br>
Those shadowy things and their things</p>
<p>A battery a fulcrum a stack of sheet metal<br>
We go between the light and the night</p>
<p>A Personal Assistant a MALM bed frame<br>
We have no plot, we are completely</p>
<p>Ungrounded, nothing but dependent<br>
And changeable forms of praxis</p>
<p>There are still wild berries bitter but edible<br>
And root vegetables generally disliked</p>
<p>Turned on their heads without realizing<br>
There are still people who do not want to</p>
<p>Know what they want, there are still<br>
People who like me know how</p>
<p>To earn enough money to reproduce<br>
Themselves but don&#146;t want to reproduce</p>
<p>Themselves that way or this way<br>
There are still clients and patients and colleagues all</p>
<p>Waiting for their moment in the sun<br>
Beating down like a sun
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Made of chocolate and dreams and automation</p>
<p>I feel desperate to show you a category<br>
But there are still people who have none</p>
<p>I feel full of impersonal compulsions<br>
But it must differ it must be unique</p>
<p>Advance on the hill of implacable concepts<br>
A loyalty day a demand for free speech</p>
<p>There are those of moralizing aspect<br>
Keen to point out our consistent defeat but</p>
<p>The meagre turnip the meek rutabaga<br>
Can&#146;t be the only impossible vision</p>
<p>Go about your day as you really are<br>
In the growing gulf of dying stars</p>
<p>There are still people who like a long arc<br>
Or a long march or a long day on your feet</p>
<p>Appear to turn unfettered yet there they are<br>
And there in action still is the moon</p>
<p>Imitating its own waxing and waning<br>
making it difficult not to commit arson</p>
<p>I resealed the box that made you better<br>
There are still people locked out of it, thus</p>
<p>I reinvented the loaf of bread<br>
There are still tactics like this roaming free</p>
