title: Editor&rsquo;s Note
---

<p>Jack Whitten has been a dear friend and mentor to the <em>Rail</em> ever since our journal was founded in October 2000. Jack's resilient spirit, generosity, and compassion have been an inspiration to all of us. Due to Jack&rsquo;s recent passing, I&rsquo;ve asked several of his old and new friends including Lydia Dona, Guy Goodwin, Odili Donald Odita, David Reed, Richard Shiff, Ron Gorchov, Stanley Whitney, and myself included, to contribute our reflections and observations on what Jack has meant to our life and work, our contemporary painting culture, and beyond. </p>
