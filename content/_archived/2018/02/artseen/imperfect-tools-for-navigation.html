<p>&nbsp;Curated by the Philadelphia-based artist-run space High-Tide gallery and hosted by American Medium,&nbsp;<em>Imperfect Tools for Navigation</em>&nbsp;showcases the work of three intermedia artists working in disparate formats; Devin Morris shows photography and collage, James Bouch&eacute; employs digital fabrication methods, and Jared Rush Jackson works with video. These artists confuse existing genres&mdash;editorial photography, metal music, commercial art direction&mdash;by fraying the edges of their corresponding formal vernaculars. Apparel becomes drape, which in turn becomes a kind of topography. A graphic tee becomes an encryption technology. Branded logos are used to complicate, rather than epitomize identity.&nbsp;</p>!!img2!!
<p>Devin Morris&rsquo;s photographs&mdash;self-described as at least partially&nbsp;<a href="http://www.devinnmorris.com/bio/">inspired</a>&nbsp;by &ldquo;his later experiences navigating the world as a black queer man&rdquo;&mdash;are of young black men against improvised backdrops of stretched fabric. One stands, arms raised in a boxer&rsquo;s stance, wearing a white cropped tunic. There&rsquo;s an allusion to the vernacular of editorial photography, insofar as the textiles contour, complicate, and contextualize the silhouette of the figure; that said, there are no brands here. The form of the fold&mdash;<a href="http://www.simonosullivan.net/articles/deleuze-dictionary.pdf">mobilized</a>&nbsp;by Gilles Deleuze as a model for imagining and critiquing the process of subject-production&mdash;competes with the models as the focus of the images. Morris regards fabric as a vessel for memory; to me, drapery in its manifold forms&mdash;veils, curtains, rags, flags, tents&mdash;can constitute a terrain upon which racial insiders versus outsiders are disputed. Geographer Arun Saldanha&rsquo;s framing of race as a machinic assemblage comes to mind; Saldanha writes in&nbsp;<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7aa7/ffb9ffba9c35be0795308f5d2c06a953efc8.pdf"><em>Reontologising race: the machinic geography of phenotype</em></a>, &ldquo;race should not be eliminated, but proliferated, its many energies directed at multiplying racial differences so as to render them joyfully cacophonic.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Rahm 1</em>, the model, wearing tight red pants and an oversized golden shawl, leans on a wooden staff; the slightly refractive garment proliferates, potentially forever in an irreducible aggregate of forms upon forms.</p>!!img3!!
<p>The fold reemerges in James Bouch&eacute;&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Where the Veil is Thin</em>, a wall-vinyl translation of the edge contour of a gossamer fabric. The defining characteristics of the imagined cloth&mdash;its translucency, its motion, and its sheen&mdash;are reduced and fixed as pure line. Bouch&eacute; applies a similar treatment in&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t Piss on My Leg</em>, in which a piece of acrylic is laser-cut and etched to resemble a T-shirt featuring an indecipherable metal logo. In his essay on metal logos, &ldquo;<a href="http://veryinteractive.net/content/4-library/40-crypto-logo-jihad/vandervelden-cryptologojihad.pdf">Crypto Logo Jihad</a>,&rdquo; Daniel van der Velden, co-founder of the design/research studio&nbsp;<a href="http://metahaven.net/">Metahaven</a>, traces the fraught emergence of the illegible metal logo, from the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_St%C3%BCrmer">typography of the Third Reich</a>&nbsp;to its subsumption into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kiss-nazi-logo_us_577430ade4b0bd4b0b13779c">style of hard rock</a>, before evolving into the spiky, intricate forms that are sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeYfO9XlPQi/">caricatured</a>&nbsp;today. Van der Velden also draws a correspondence between the logo-as-password and contemporary forms of encryption like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>. A digital object of sorts,&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t Piss on My Leg</em>&nbsp;is a surrogate for another kind of encrypted object: the T-shirt with its specialized insider ciphers of a particular subculture.</p>
<p>Typographic logos also make an appearance in Jared Rush Jackson&rsquo;s two video works, titled&nbsp;<em>Carbon</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Granite</em>&nbsp;respectively. Spinning outlined wordmarks are plotted along the outside of a circle; one reads SPIRAL LIKE BLACK HAIR, the other REPEAT UNTIL FADE. These slogans are overlaid on top of a screen capture video of a user zooming and scrolling around black-and-white Photoshop documents, one labeled <em>hair_study_006.jpg</em> the other cryptically titled <em>010513.psd</em>. The images, themselves abstractions of hair and other organic matter, are periodically interrupted by other collaged video elements&mdash;a detail of what looks like the collar of a leather jacket, a sad-face drawn on the signature line of an iPad check-out app, maybe a scanned wallet. Like Morris&rsquo;s- work, the piece stylistically draws from the vernacular of commercial design (the collage work of Brooklyn-based designer/artist&nbsp;<a href="http://hassanrahim.tumblr.com/">Hassan Rahim</a>&nbsp;comes to mind). Instead of communicating one thing (a brand identity) there&rsquo;s a kind of proliferation of symbols and linguistic association; REPEAT UNTIL FADE might refer to the audio of&nbsp;<em>Carbon</em>&mdash;a repeated loop of what sounds like someone clicking play on a short MIDI loop on a computer&mdash;or to black hairstyles, or to both (&agrave; la the prolific genre-defying musician Dean Blunt&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WoAo57HKLk"><em>Skin Fade Album</em></a>). Meanwhile, the voiceover to&nbsp;<em>Granite</em>&mdash;an indignant repetition of two voices saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; at the same time&mdash;speaks to a sort of stasis. Viewing and hearing&nbsp;<em>Granite</em>&nbsp;invokes a similar feeling to taking an automated peripheral&nbsp;<a href="http://eyewiki.aao.org/Standard_Automated_Perimetry">visual field test</a>; the eye&rsquo;s focus stays central while various stimuli test the integrity of peripheral vision with varying visual and auditory intensities.</p>
<p>Prolonged interrogation reveals that the works in&nbsp;<em>Imperfect Tools For Navigation</em>&nbsp;do not just operate in service of wayfinding, as the press release explicates, but as spaces to be navigated themselves. Bouch&eacute;&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Where the Veil Is Thin&nbsp;</em>exemplifies this spatializing tendency; in an economical manner, it effectively imposes dimensionality on the gallery wall. Despite consisting of only planar works,&nbsp;<em>Imperfect Tools For Navigation&nbsp;</em>should be understood as a series of imagined spaces constituted through Jackson&rsquo;s layered topographies, Morris&rsquo; placeless tapestry forts, and Bouch&eacute;&rsquo;s surrogate gestures. Within each space, recognizable genres are stretched, inverted, exaggerated, and confused.</p>
