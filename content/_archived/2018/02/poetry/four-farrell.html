<p><strong>Dogs Eat The Moon. Lord Marmalade Blames Spain</strong></p>
<br>
<p>He flew to investigate<br>
In Spain they shook their heads, said no dogs here 
Look! only cats
They put a special viewing box on Lord Marmalade&rsquo;s head
and he looked through a hole which almost broke his specs</p>

<p>Can a cat be a dog&rsquo;s shadow?<br>
If Lord Marmalade has never been to Spain, and the Spain
he blames is the Spain of his brain, then the dogs must be
there somewhere
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;He turned a hair
He looked in the shadows of his mind, behind the bumps 
of the rindy landscape
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; It all seemed too filled in, like they
knew the king was coming
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;The sky possessed a faultless
too black moonlessness
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were donkeys dragging ploughs
through the streets and turning up green computers, little
smartphone clods
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;The cinemas showed big blue women on
golden screens looking for their motorbikes stolen by gang-
sters who turned out to be their own orphan cousins, and 
ended in blowing up a factory and inventing a lucrative new 
vinyl fashion product
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t find a trace of moonlight
or phoniness anywhere, and spent the night in a gutter at-
tracting insects
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At about 4am the wind took the telescope 
off the cathedral, knocking it against the bell, waking him
he felt like a dry lemon
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet through his left eye he saw a
figure
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was a figure of Talk
Lord Marmalade began to speak to the dogs, asking them to
come out, to own up, to bring back, to spit out the moon</p>

<p>The figure turned<br>
It was the ghost of Lorca, asking the time
Lord Marmalade felt his spine trying to align
He saw, he felt, a rain of fleas falling out the sky
When the fleas stop falling there will be nothing, or the moon
said Lorca
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lord Marmalade followed him down a street
under an archway, past an aqueduct, into a white courtyard</p>

<p>Lorca disappeared<br>
Lord Marmalade began to realise how thirsty he was: an an-
cient-looking bubbler like a fire hydrant appeared
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His tongue 
in the unsweet Spanish water seemed to flap
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was fur-
ther from the truth than ever</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schmeducation </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Due to the weather, apparently, their dad<br>
cancelled the skiing holiday in Aspen. He
booked a cabin closer to home and told 
them they were in for a time of intense
delight, or instruction. Later, they&rsquo;d form
a band called In Slight Destruction, but</p>

<p>for now it was four weeks of Dylan<br>
<em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> to be precise
morning and afternoon and at night
they&rsquo;d karaoke the moon. They put
it down, partly, to their dad being Bob 
too &ndash; born too early to be a Dylan</p>

<p>Bobby Tulow he was growing up, or<br>
Bobby 2-Love, whatever that meant
but it came from the Queen song, even
the teachers would half-sing can an-
y-body, find me, Bobby 2-Love? No-
body ever could, then. So it seemed</p>

<p>that for them, music and thinking were<br>
fated to be entwined. These songs would
never leave them. They would be at
any kind of sporting fixture, and as soon
as there was a winner, a rising tune
in their heads would preempt the journos</p>

<p>going How Does It Feel? They call<br>
graves Tom-stones. Their dad tells
them songs are not just to listen or
dance to, they have lives and souls
and you have to watch them until
you feel them inside you, like birds</p>

<p>They change the taste of hunger, he<br>
adds. Sit at a table with nothing to eat
and you imagine someone looking in
the alley for a meal. A mum wearing
trackpants is for them a gritty meme
It takes a card to deal, it takes a dream</p>

<p>to fly, or a peach, or a cow. Well now<br>
you know something about the mind
of a Jewish boho genius circa 1965
their mum says. Next time (it takes
a scream) next time it will be <em>Blue!
Blood on the Tracks! The Blueprint!
Blonde on Blonde!</em> Oh, schmeducation</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pope Pinocchio&rsquo;s Godmother </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a piece of paper and a piece of coal. Make a<br>
snowman. There were lions on the beach this 
morning, as if misplaced. The wardrobe from <em>King 
Lear</em> stood on the nature strip. Poised, as you would 
say of a violet in the field. A field of green that 
exists for itself, coldly and cleanly, with no memory</p>

<p>of mice or ground birds. That has been swept by <br>
unemployed milkmaids for a cup of oats or an 
avocado. It&rsquo;s good to be here wherever we are, in 
the realm of empty stables and hospitals and doctors 
roaming loose with dangerous eyes and laughing 
complexions. Each one with an emu on a leather </p>

<p>leash that they call their mother and maybe is. Such <br>
comforting, safe wrists they have. Louis Vitton 
mascara dripping through the grass. No one will eat 
it now, I hope. The whole ensemble rides on a cart 
and might collapse if pushed, though probably no 
one would think of such a thing; it requires a certain </p>

<p>perspective on the world, that comes with broom <br>
travel or chronic celibacy or sleep deprivation or 
inhaling ground opal from soggy woollen backs 
Blow your wooden nose, I say. Eat your wooden 
milk. Bring a stripe of the sky and a piece of coal
like a brain. They&#146;re playing our poem nearby</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There Was A Man La-la La-la</strong></p>
<br>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man stood on a hill like the <br>
beginning of an alphabet</p>

<p>He had a refrain in his head of red or leaves <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or grief</p>

<p>He was in theory visible to all, but not all<br>
noticed he was there</p>

<p>None &ndash; without a telescope or a surveillance <br>
camera &ndash; could see his face or speculate on 
how he felt; at best they could say how they 
felt on seeing him</p>

<p>He resembled a jar, from afar</p>

<p>He resembled a ladder with the spaces filled in</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bird flew into the man&#146;s head</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It had been flying in that direction for <br>
some time</p>

<p>No one was watching but the surveillance <br>
cameras, and maybe a crow, watching the 
swallow</p>

<p>The man said an onomatopoeiac word which<br>
rhymed with the sound the bird made, a bit 
like a hello-as-accident</p>

<p>Maybe there was a currawong in a tree <br>
providing backup, and no crow for miles</p>

<p>Just a peewee flying into a man&rsquo;s head when <br>
there was plenty of space around it</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was said that he had been on the <br>
phone the whole time, but the bush telegraph
disagreed about whether it was a good or bad
place for a signal</p>

<p>The phone call was being recorded and was<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eventually tweeted, squawks and all
peee-ee</p>

<p>Perhaps it was fake though</p>

<p>Perhaps being on the phone seemed more<br>
normal than what he was actually doing</p>

<p>Maybe he was operating a drone, following<br>
someone</p>

<p>Maybe he wanted to get away from cameras<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and phones: maybe he was a son of
lightning and was saying here I am, hit me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
