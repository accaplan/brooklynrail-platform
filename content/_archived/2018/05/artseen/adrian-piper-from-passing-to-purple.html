<p><em>Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965&ndash;2016 </em>is not the systematic web of blunt perceptions the exhibition&rsquo;s title would have you believe. With nearly three-hundred works spanning the entire sixth floor of MoMA&mdash;a first for a living artist&mdash;the exhibition demands its audience bring with it a willingness to work, both objectively and subjectively, for <em>reason</em>. For me, this was an isolating experience as I struggled to flow with the uncontested praise that&rsquo;s accompanied this seminal, far-reaching exhibition. While I have always valued the profoundly poetic explorations of self and community found in Piper&rsquo;s earlier works, I experienced a crisis of conscience as I moved through the final galleries.</p>
<p>My own intuitions felt shamefully in conflict with those rendered visible by the artist whose brave work has opened doors for a liberated woman such as myself to find footing in this world of institutionalized art. The emotional labor it took to weather Piper&rsquo;s persistent and at times injurious provocations, as in <em>Imagine [Trayvon Martin]</em> (2013)&mdash;alongside the series of moral negotiations I encountered as the exhibition shifted perspective from self to other to othering in its depictions of black bodies&mdash;left me in pieces. I had longingly prepared myself for the instigation that has come to define many of Piper&rsquo;s bold gestures as an artist, however, I was wholly unprepared for the sunken place I found myself in as I stepped out of the exhibition and back into my very black, American life.</p>
<p>What follows is a hypothetical interview with the artist who, to my knowledge, no longer grants them and has expatriated to Berlin:&nbsp;</p>
<div class="image" style="float:left;width:300px">!!img1!!</div><p><strong>Q: </strong>An important subtext to your early drawings is the role of the then-legal drug LSD as the genesis of self-portraiture in your practice. During your late &rsquo;60s self-exploration in altered perception, the concurrent Black Arts Movement and Civil Rights Movement was awakening a collective black consciousness and imagination. What do these early self-portraits reveal about how you saw yourself at that time? Did your experimentations in liberation from the body&mdash;your body&mdash;also imagine the liberation of other black bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>In the <em>Vanilla Nightmares</em> series (1986), you combat notions of white fragility and privilege by appropriating and repurposing pages from the <em>New York Times</em> as a canvas for your own figural ruminations on race. Nude black figures engulf and penetrate the headlines of American history, challenging their veracity and offering an alternate reality. In your self-portraits&mdash;specifically <em>Self-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features </em>(1981) and <em>Self-Portrait as a Nice White Lady </em>(1995)&mdash;you name race more directly in your lingual framing of the works. As an artist, do you think it is easier to discuss race through a self-referential lens when language is at play?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>The <em>Mythic Being</em> series marks a seismic shift in your practice&mdash;performance art seems to untether your gaze from self and open up metaphysical terrain in which to imagine and refigure the other. Your body becomes a powerful medium, and embodied gestures expose and redirect the projections of others onto your identity and form. I imagine you learned a great deal about those you encountered as your alter-ego. What did this process teach you about your physical, spiritual and emotional selves?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>As an artist whose unyielding work has often explored the social constructions that put democracy at risk of self-deconstruction, what communities do you consider yourself to be a part of? How and where do these communities&mdash;and the theoretical audiences for your work&mdash;intersect? In what ways are you present and absent for these interactions?&nbsp;</p>!!img3!!
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Many responded in arms to Dana Schutz&rsquo;s, <em>Open Casket, </em>depicting slain Emmett Till in the 2016 Whitney Biennial. This uproar marked only a recent chapter in the mounting resistance to the spectacle and consumption of black death in art. It also rearticulated a set of unspoken rules around representation, solidarity, and the materialization of other&rsquo;s trauma. In your opinion, what do works like <em>Free #2</em> (1989) and <em>Imagine [Trayvon Martin]</em> (2013)&mdash;which depict a lynching, police brutality, and Trayvon Martin&rsquo;s face obscured by a crosshair&mdash;add to this conversation? And, in the ironic titling of these works, how does your summoning of &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; and &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; resonate against the lived experiences of these slain black men?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>As an expatriate who has selectively disengaged from the very real trappings of race and nationality, how do you see and engage the struggle of black America today? I&rsquo;ve heard that you no-longer identify as black, and have shed that aspect of your identity for purple. How does the privilege of purple intersect with making work about the black experience?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Upon exiting the galleries, I participated in <em>The Rules of the Game #2, </em>a performance installation in which I signed a certified contract with you, binding me to &ldquo;always mean what I say,&rdquo; a promise I am privileged to make. As someone now bound to you, I wonder in what ways you feel and <em>are</em> bound to me, and what form this conversation takes if you don&rsquo;t show up.</p>
