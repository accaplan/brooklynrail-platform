<p class="blockquote"><em>&ldquo;In whatever way and through whatever means a cognition may relate to objects, that through which it relates immediately to them and at which all thought as a means is directed an ends is intuition.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="quote-attribution">&ndash;Immanuel Kant, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like people to sit in the bleachers,&rdquo; Adrian Piper tells us, &ldquo;and think of where they are sitting as an amphitheater of the sort that one would sit in to watch Christians being devoured by the lions.&rdquo; This is our introduction to <em>Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965&ndash;2016 </em>on the second floor in the Marron Atrium of the Museum of Modern Art.&nbsp;Printed on the wall, the artist&rsquo;s premise registers as instruction; you enter the arena&nbsp;and are immediately inside a bright cube, with tiered seating and a grid of fluorescent lights in the drop down ceiling. Around the room, the scene repeats itself in the mirrors that line the walls. You are watching a video screen mounted on a central column, where a man recites a litany or creed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shiftless.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not crazy.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not servile.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not stupid.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not dirty.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sneaky.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not childish.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not evil.&rdquo; The man is black. The arena is white.&nbsp;The devouring lions, indeed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been seated here by the artist. But what is your position with regard to the object? Piper&rsquo;s special power is to locate you in space and time, where you become part of the work. You&rsquo;re a thing she is thinking, and so you are the object. But you are also thinking and seeing what&rsquo;s happening in this arena of consciousness, and so you are both object and subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All hail Adrian Piper: pioneering Conceptual artist, philosopher, lion tamer. <em>Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965&ndash;2016 </em>is the artist&rsquo;s first major American exhibition in nearly twenty years. MoMA, in collaboration with the Hammer Museum, presents over 290 works by the artist, from early paintings made in the 1960s&mdash;prismatic explorations of perception under the influence of LSD&mdash;to her white panopticon, <em>What It&rsquo;s Like, What It Is #3</em>&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;to <em>The Probable Trust Registry: The Rules of the Game #1&ndash;3</em> (2013)&mdash;an exercise in social contracting that won the Golden Lion Award at the 2015 Venice Biennale.&nbsp;Piper is known for her performance works&mdash;public provocations like her male avatar, <em>The Mythic Being </em>(1973 &ndash; 75), or her pedagogical <em>Funk Lessons</em> (1983 &ndash; 84)&mdash;but this huge exhibition demonstrates her polyglot mastery of objects, images, and text.</p>
<p>In the first gallery, there is the grid: the graph paper geometries of first-wave Conceptualism,&nbsp;which offered Piper a language for thinking clearly, concretely, and systematically about objecthood and the matrices of perception.&nbsp;Under&nbsp;the influence of Sol LeWitt&mdash;an early supporter of her work&mdash;Piper&nbsp;explored the formal and representational possibilities of language and materials. Her &ldquo;Hypothesis&rdquo; series (1968 &ndash; 70) maps photographs of objects in her home or neighborhood onto the <em>xy</em> axis of space and time. These coordinate planes continued to inform her field of awareness as her work became increasingly personal, confrontational, and embodied.</p>
<p>In 1970,&nbsp;she appeared at the downtown art bar Max&rsquo;s Kansas City wearing elbow-length satin gloves and a blindfold. The action demonstrated her commitment to her own compass&mdash;her refusal to be co-opted by the Downtown art scene. As she wrote later. &ldquo;I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t want to be absorbed as a collaborator&hellip; It would mean allowing my consciousness to be influenced by their perceptions of art, and exposing my perceptions of art to their consciousness, and I didn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the artist does not collaborate with prevailing social attitudes or habits, she must become an agent of change. Since the 1970s, she has critiqued the ideologies of racism&nbsp;and sexism through direct address to the viewer (&ldquo;Pretend not to know what you know&rdquo;). When presenting material from her own life, as in her &ldquo;Political Self Portrait&rdquo; series (1978 &ndash; 80), her aim is not simply&nbsp;to exorcise the traumas of growing up black, female, or poor, but to confront the viewer with her own biases about race, gender, or class.</p>
<p>In the last gallery, Piper&rsquo;s vision seems to widen in scope. In her &ldquo;Everything&rdquo; series (2003 &ndash; 13), she prints photographic portraits on graph paper. Each face is rubbed out and replaced with text: &ldquo;Everything will be taken away.&rdquo; You wonder: Is this <em>her</em> office? Are these the faces of <em>her</em> family and friends? Or her? But unlike her &ldquo;Hypothesis&rdquo; work, individual identity and historical presence are effaced in the&nbsp;unplotted&nbsp;points of the grid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In her &ldquo;Vanishing Point&rdquo; series (2009 &ndash; 11), she manipulates the substrate itself, altering or rubbing out the columns and rows of expense reports and other official documents. She overlays them with shaded drawings of concentric circles: the O with no beginning or end&mdash;the great all and nothing. You might see this work as a response to aging or a position arrived at through her longtime practice of meditation and yoga. Still, she continues to target the social forces that enact the corrosions of time. In <em>Imagine [Trayvon Martin]</em> (2013) the concentric circles and <em>xy</em> axis become a gunsight framing the face of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African American teenager shot and killed unrepentantly by George Zimmerman while on foot in his Florida neighborhood.</p>

<p>Piper&rsquo;s strategy, throughout her work, is to hack our ethical motivation through our cognitive faculties: our ability to distinguish difference or recognize commonalities; our susceptibility to change in the course of a relational encounter. Our reason <em>can</em> pilot the chariot, she thinks, relieving us of the crushing drives of our own desires and delusions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, she&rsquo;s after freedom&mdash;from the tyranny of other minds and the bogus authority of one&rsquo;s own bias. Though her Kantian commitments and her spiritual practice inform her idea of freedom, here, her quest becomes most vivid when she&rsquo;s dancing. Think of&nbsp;your delight, coming out of the last gallery to see Piper dancing alone in Alexanderplatz. The video work, <em>Adrian Arrives in Berlin </em>(2007), was made after Piper, abroad, found herself on the TSA's suspicious traveler list. Rather than return to the U.S.&mdash;becoming complicit with the government verdict&mdash;Piper settled permanently in Berlin. In the video, we see&nbsp;Piper grooving over a grid of concrete tiles in the public square. Improvising, her&nbsp;body makes&nbsp;its own&nbsp;arc&nbsp;like the line of the&nbsp;circle traversing the grid, cutting across space and time.&nbsp;She&rsquo;s on the run, saying &ldquo;Fuck it.&nbsp;Let's boogie.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
