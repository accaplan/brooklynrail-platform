<p><strong>Unhappy Folklore</strong></p>
<br>
<p>The composition goes loopy the longer he plays<br>
Reeds bust the windscreen
Dresses unfurl and furl throughout the Savoy
Ecstatic discipline for small fee
The beat&rsquo;s only a dream unless you dance</p>

<p>Seventeen-chair blowout, Casa Loma<br>
Van Vechten takes the dream to darkroom
Couples take the street as real
Liberty so momentary
Jim Crow one car behind
Drive home that third-hand Packard
past dark windows of unhappy folklore</p>

<p>Race to the Side eighty years on<br>
Hands on the wheel, wheels on the shoulder
Driver&rsquo;s-side palaver is racial
Dash compartment is
All conveyance is racial
Color deepens to be alive and ride
Halfway free should you die</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>













<p><strong>Face States</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Laws keep secrets by memory<br>
Purple light from forehead like military exhaust
No more left arm, no more meat in stall
Fleet foot too slow for &lsquo;tonation
Sweetness is empty threats everywhere</p>

<p>Cyclops takes to instruction and perceives depth<br>
Fearful peek at skyline horizon
What if missiles were to devour
Every face states it, especially the dim</p>

<p>Strike a match, dark target<br>
Don&rsquo;t slice the ground like you usta
Don&rsquo;t crowd bullets, breathe condiments to go
They suck buildings flat now
Keep children indoors?</p>

<p>Wrapped inside arms still<br>
warm, no longer brown
Every color skin 
turns the same gray</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Whispers All the Time</strong></p>
<p class="quote-attribution"><em>in memory of Larry Fagin</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>To be outside yourself is not to be everywhere<br>
You go home across the river, like in the song</p>

<p>Whispers break my heart when<br>
I hear whispers all the time</p>

<p>Fastidiousness is the science for children<br>
Never after will they be ignorant</p>

<p>Difference between opinions is attitude<br>
Attitude&rsquo;s a lesson in a storm</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t they know nuthin &lsquo;bout vehicles?<br>
Voices carry that I argue with</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t choose an older brother until<br>
there is an exception misfits</p>

<p>Then he goes where many others<br>
likewise are more than less asleep</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Good Outcomes</strong></p>
<br>
<p>In April you try plans<br>
Turns into May
Best thing is I don&rsquo;t know bleep</p>

<p>Take dressing for sun<br>
Time after time bad target
Elevated by ungodly machine
is of <em>good</em> outcomes</p>

<p>Of all sacks what sack fits?<br>
I call you without lines
Does anything come of no one?</p>

<p>And turn into sand no salt<br>
Deep hole it all disappears
Guttural languages: lost
Sliver in tragus: rare
Armband from funeral home</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t go away in madness<br>
Don&rsquo;t go away too sure
What a devil says computes
Go ahead, have a hey-day
Sun squeezes into tight sky
Man walks blocks in search</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
