<p class="quote-attribution">- Robert Rauschenberg</p><p>Butch Morris was a friend and a hard task master. When he started A Chorus of Poets, I and the late poet John Farris were asked to join. Being the rebellious, attention-deficit-type of kids we were, we quit during (not after) the first rehearsal. Learning the signals and following orders were just not in the mix for us. Here&rsquo;s some pieces for Butch:</p><p>Conduction #Infinity (Out of Reach but Never Out of Touch) &ndash; for Butch Morris</p>

Butch: his mischievous smile &gt; stern look &gt; open laugh &gt; dapper apparel &gt; a real dandy &gt; like back in the days when &gt; his midrange slightly twanged voice &gt; everything I&rsquo;ll say is clich&eacute;d pompous emotional &gt; rubbed in ashes at times &gt; such elaborate performance we produce sometimes for no one &gt; the wind &gt; trees &gt; the rushing water &gt; walking on hot coals to emit a portrait of pain &gt; among the last &amp; first budding flowers &amp; weeds &gt; his baton / those lighter than air dancing shoes &gt; gentlemanliness &gt; his overall attire that gruff little me admired so much &gt; his NEATNESS &gt; those dancing shoes those dancing shoes &gt; that held him firmly in place &gt; he passed the way neighbour- hoods pass yet always sustain their quality &gt; personality &gt; somewhere in the brick &gt; the way seasons pass &amp; are replaced always by hosts of new hustlers &gt; new lovers&gt; &amp; he one of the last of the real of the real &gt; a unique lover of the unique &amp; loved by all &gt; the unique &amp; mundane alike &gt; come again next fall &gt; winter &gt; spring &gt; summer &gt; come again in storm &amp; dust &gt; those dancing shoes that I wanted so much &gt; last of the real of the real &gt; dancing on indifferent waters&hellip;</p>

<p>I dedicate this to Cecil Taylor, who was a&nbsp;hero, friend, mentor, continuing inspiration, composer, improvisor, dancer, poet, crazy genius, and like Butch an uncompromising artist and human being who lived life on his own terms. May he reside in peaceful chaos and tell his stories forever.</p>
