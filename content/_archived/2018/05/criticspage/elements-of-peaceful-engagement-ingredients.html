title: Elements of Peaceful Engagement. Ingredients
---

<p>Migration is connected with communication and the decision making process.</p>
<p>As an artist working in many different cultural backgrounds these aspects are fundamental to my daily practice, which is based on several inter-textual fields: language and its typographic representation and humanistic speculation in a field of communication.</p>
<p>In the <em>Elements of Peaceful Engagement </em>I continue analyzing various parameters of language structures: protocols, classifications, system of methods, concept of strategy. These instruments of a daily routine implement an idea of a workplace and influence an atmosphere of physical and mental movement in the decision-making process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In writing this essay I sub-borrowed the title of my latest work series <em>Elements of Peaceful Engagement </em>and added to it the word <em>Ingredients. </em>The title becomes a work itself and occurs in two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a field of communication the first noticeable aspect is a melody; the <em>Elements of Peaceful Engagement </em>as a word construction evokes a soothing rhythm that stimulates occurrence of abstract meanings.</li>
<li>I invented a Character (an abstract personality) who is named Elements of Peaceful Engagement and which addresses a dynamic of work relationships under certain strategic system.</li><br>
</ol>
<p>These two sections recall a linguistic grammar of the workspace environment, yet adequately the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; create an index of calibrated parameters to diagnose the effectiveness of communication.</p>
<p>Each ingredient of <em>Elements of Peaceful Engagement</em> contains: percent of errors*, percent of uncertainty of measurement, percent of doubt, percent angles, percent shapes, percent double, percent option, and percent discrete.</p>
<p>The words discrete, double, and option are connected to the intrinsic behavior and tone of communication; they relate to hidden protocols and play important role in the decision-making process by orienting the scope of possibilities. The word <em>Discrete</em> is particular, it initiates an arrangement to communicate on subtle levels where words are not always needed and where the unspoken contract creates somehow intimate relationship. These attributes influence communication in a workspace environment. However one of most intriguing aspects is a non-strategic approach based on ones own experience in a process of informal, intuitive, verbal, two-way communications. It is a process of sensing the entire organizational methods and relevant situations. In such process of communicating, the intellectual methods are going hand-in-hand with techniques that are based on feeling appropriate-ness; this assists to build a new system: strategy as learning.</p>
<p>By writing this essay, my purpose was to affirm the word &ldquo;migration&rdquo; as a transition, an expansion of thought through the decision-making process and non-strategic system.</p>
<p>This essay is a migration itself or a thought migration accomplished in the process of communication.</p>
<p>* Percent of errors: If words are not innocent, it means an error cannot be underestimated, an error as a divergence from the initial intention is a result of the unpredictability and can be turned into a valuable moment of pause to redefine a distracted process.</p>
