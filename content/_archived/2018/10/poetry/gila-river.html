<p class="blockquote"><em><strong>for Yoshiko Kanazawa</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prisoners lived for many years&mdash;<br>
had children&ensp;&ensp;grandchildren great-grandchildren</p>
<p>burned&ensp;&ensp;very quietly<br>   
to ash,</p>   
<br>  
<p>cut rectangles in the floor&ensp;&ensp;dug holes in the dirt<br>
to stay cool 
in July&ensp;&ensp;folded their bodies
like paper&ensp;&ensp;fell asleep 
in the holes&ensp;&ensp;rivers evaporated. The prisoners disintegrated
Not even their secrets</p>
<br>  
<p>Japanese Americans were not looking at themselves<br>  
turning white
not the cotton&ensp;&ensp;not the descendants of bloodless cotton
the children&#146;s fathers refused to pick</p>
<p>Children were shy&ensp;&ensp;had stories to tell,<br>
not their own, but those not resolved, still dirty</p>
<br>  
<p>a nisei woman was asked if she would like to speak, share her story<br>
the people&ensp;&ensp;facing the gleaming snow 
looked sad, for a moment, &ensp;&ensp;then vulturous. sad again</p>
<p>expectant, ready to ascend. </p>
<p>The nisei woman shook her head,&ensp;&ensp;No, she said. <br>
Are you sure, she was asked.   
I don&#146;t remember enough 
to share&ensp;&ensp;She said   
As she was looking through the snow&ensp;&ensp;She remembered everything
but could not, seven decades later, associate herself with the subjects</p>
<br>  
<p>When the children arrived, there were turtles Snapping turtles<br>   
like helmets&ensp;&ensp;greeted the children
Turtles deep 
deep deep 
in the ditches, slowly rose&ensp;&ensp;and snapped at the children   
like Yoshiko,&ensp;&ensp;wearing a dress&ensp;&ensp;of her mother&#146;s crumpled face,   
walked right up to the ditch   
and peered in: </p>  
<p>children were grabbed, pulled in, became turtles</p>
<p>How could she forget<br>
the turtles were the solace of America
<br>  
<p>You don&#146;t forget&ensp;&ensp;You are tricked,<br>
into putting your hand in   
mirror-green water. Your hand stays stuck</p>
<p>you stop looking   </p>
<br>  
<p>eyes were olives. Children were torches</p>
<p>One of each twin drowned<br>
or burned down
to the dirt
where grandparents&ensp;&ensp;on their hands and knees
re-enacted the rose, the thorn</p>
<br>  
<p>Long hair dangled <br>  
over water&ensp;&ensp;seasons stretched 
camouflage nets 
across the suburbs. shotgun shells&ensp;&ensp;spoons, heels of shoes, 
talons, forked tongues, arrow-tipped tails, 
the wake of a temple
men sitting beneath spiraling flowers</p>
<br>  
<p>mother was very popular <br>
with the ghosts
that grew out of the ditches&ensp;&ensp;they were soldiers
deep into the harmony of their hunger</p>
<br>  
<p>Children sat on the hill<br>
watched the desert changing colors&ensp;&ensp;the stars
lower 
on tendons</p>
<p>movies smelled&ensp;&ensp;Carcasses came out</p>
<p>to narrate the silences</p>
<p>some sank into the cold, impenetrable shrapnel<br>   
fallen from tens of thousands of miles</p> 
<br>  
<p>only children remember to forget<br> 
with such warm innocence&ensp;&ensp;being struck   
by the sun   
not innocence Guilt 
not the opposite of innocence&ensp;&ensp;But 
like the dissolution of a flower into fruit,
compensation
and the will to be stolen</p>
<br>  
<p>Noriyuki was eleven, had spinal TB<br>  
when he was incarcerated as an enemy of the United States&ensp;&ensp;His body was cut 
from the cast&ensp;&ensp;and propped up
in front of the moving mirage&ensp;&ensp;Noriyuki, 
better
or worse known as 
Mr. Miyagi, for whom Noriyuki put on the accent
of an immigrant from Okinawa</p>
<p>His inscrutability was part of the trick&ensp;&ensp;the coming into consciousness<br>
of a Japanese man
who had no one&ensp;&ensp;war extinguished 
Truth, &ensp;&ensp;the country trained him
to be someone else, &ensp;&ensp;not other, but native
by pretending to be someone else,&ensp;&ensp;not native, but foreign</p>   
<p>He stood in the bush<br>  
until the bush became ice</p>
<p>When Mr. Miyagi gets drunk&ensp;&ensp;and relives the war<br>
are we not supposed to imagine Noriyuki, the actor,
summoning the memory
of the war he was living
as a child&ensp;&ensp;prisoner</p>
<p>is that misunderstanding<br>
or a misunderstanding</p>
<br>  
<p>Did you have anyone in the 442<sup>nd</sup><br>
No, I said,&ensp;&ensp;My ancestors are not corpses
propped upright in the corner
My ancestors do not stand in cold rooms in the dark&ensp;&ensp;draped with lights
round cancerous&ensp;&ensp;in which my face is warped&ensp;&ensp;waiting 
to be turned on&ensp;&ensp;dance in the window</p>
<br>  
<p>From afar&ensp;&ensp;incarceration looks like internment<br>
<p>It is always day<br>  
No&ensp;&ensp;Japanese Americans exist
at night&ensp;&ensp;The river is full&ensp;&ensp;Japanese Americans gather
in the sundown&ensp;&ensp;on the banks of the abundant river
to pay respects
to the primal thinking
of white men and women,&ensp;&ensp;distant, futuristic
summer&ensp;&ensp;or winter
or walking down the reservation</p>
<br>  
<p>wild animals raised their heads&ensp;&ensp;land stretched away <br>  
The further away from the train
the less it moved</p>
<p>children watched their parents&#146; faces <br>  
framed in squares 
and rectangles of light&ensp;&ensp;seam of stars, 
then dark, 
then darkness</p>   
<p>Did it feel like travel? guarantee of returning?<br>
Their movements were curtailed. sound was rhythmic suture. 
Dreams of the wheels slipping off</p>
<p>wild animals moved fast. in the shadows of rocks:</p>
<p>I will see you <br>
again. incriminated
by the sadness 
of someone else&#146;s dream</p>
<p>without ending&ensp;&ensp;migration becomes internal<br>
for those who do not leave
keep the memory leaving</p>
<p>de-located, </p>
<p>migration was a test. the destination was the extent to which<br>
a soul could be transformed. The United States wanted to replace 
with a clock, </p>
<br>
<p>the furnace of assimilation. earth harbors <br>  
unintelligible tongues
in the core,&ensp;&ensp;tongues of flame, they are called,
the earth answers
with its cavernous body, I release you
into the custody of culture&ensp;&ensp;The toll is paid 
by the enslaved, 
exploited, exterminated</p>
<br>  
<p>How did it feel to be surrounded by Japanese Americans<br>
with whom you were not&nbsp;&nbsp;related?&ensp;&ensp;Prison 
is prolongation&ensp;&ensp;I felt like 
I was standing in 
a graveyard&ensp;&ensp;waiting for the sun
to pass into eclipse&ensp;&ensp;for the light to christen
what was buried beneath
the long, ship-like passage of shadow</p>
<p>I don&#146;t remember the way you remember<br>  
I don&#146;t remember a prison, but Easter
I don&#146;t remember which season or burying</p>
<br>  
<p>In the forbidden sight <br>
of each blackened window
a face permeated</p>
<p>the face of each <br>  
age of death.</p>
<p>fit fruitfully into <br>
a box.&ensp;&ensp;Each face was <u>made</u>&ensp;&ensp;Each face made real
pores that recalled
the frustrated youth of grandmothers.</p>
<p>Why is your skin so smooth, my grandmother asked<br>  
one night. I came out of the bathroom. I was a child. 
The night was supposed to feel endless, insatiable, 
was stunted&ensp;&ensp;I saw myself in the window&ensp;&ensp;superimposed 
on a tree,&ensp;&ensp;and a deer, with red eyes   
cut in half</p>
<p>I wash my face, I said<br>  
I wash my face too</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
