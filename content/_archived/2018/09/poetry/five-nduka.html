<p>should I acquaint you <br>
with my neurosis.
crack blackness open.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;the goddamn night.</p>
<p>the crystal carpet.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;a deadline&rsquo;s glass armor.</p>
<p>this heat in the meat<br>
of the future.</p>
<p>first trace first place.<br>
if a spotlight peeled
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;away the rain.</p>
<p>the ruins of Great Zimbabwe<br>
did not teach much to Robert Mugabe.</p>

<br>
<p>Hills momentarily rotting<br>
under the sun.</p>
<p>Semi-colons walking across<br>
saturday&#146;s bridge.</p>
<p>My messy lines do lean<br>
on my messy lives.</p>
<p>There&#146;s a party going on<br>
inside your body.</p>
<p>It&#146;s really loud.</p>

<p>He doesn&#146;t just stop<br>
at the animality of humanity.</p>
<p>Every disappearance<br>
leads to another appearance.</p>
<p>Were you there when <br>
Negritude became a tourist
attraction? Awfully so?</p>
<p>Call it dismay. How good it <br>
is to rage again. Leave
the sandbox. Stay on the lam.</p>
<p>Passing down the crown. A heart<br>
that writes. There is nothing to lose
if you wait for the tide to answer your questions.</p>
<p>At the height of it<br>
60 thousand souls took
to the streets of Paris
for your liberty in 1971.</p>
<p>Either way you kept your options open.<br>
Move it. Now.</p>

<p>In places I&#146;m getting inked<br>
can you pass the mind-flower test?
The sky is a unit in the summer
of wrath. I will live well without 
revenge. A light in the service
of language. The horn fugue
in a river birch. Simply, sincerely,
sublime. Those mutating arabesques.
A way of fooling away the days. Don&#146;t 
just sort out the fray. Flee
the norm. Make the hour glow.</p>

<p>A getaway car that never<br>
got driven. Or the woven
noons & tempos of a pink
lingerie slip. As close as
you can be in the vein of
tone & color. Mania&#146;s dinghy
willow. But nothing ever starts
from zero; no one ever begins
to exist from zero.</p>
