title: Introducing 1 by 1
---

<p>With this issue, the Artseen section of the <em>Brooklyn Rail</em> introduces a new feature titled 1 by 1. Each month we ask readers (and non-readers) of the <em>Rail</em> to send a short piece on one art work. It can be something you have always wanted to write about. It can be a spontaneous reaction to a work you are standing in front of. It can be ancient or contemporary; sound art, conceptual art, performance art, painting, drawing, sculpture, media art&mdash;whatever. It does not have to be your onetime favorite work, or even about an established piece of art. One of my favorite writings on one artwork is Nina Kachadourian&rsquo;s unforgettable piece, <a href="http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/7/orphan.php">&ldquo;Orphan&rdquo;</a> published in <em>Cabinet Magazine</em>, Issue 7, Summer 2002 under the topic of &ldquo;Failure,&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will select one or two short pieces each month. By short, ideally 500 words, but anything under 1000 will be considered.</p>
<p>1 by 1 is inspired and dedicated to the late poet, art writer, and friend of the <em>Rail</em>, Bill Berkson because perhaps no writer mastered the short form of art writing as he did. It is also inspired by his assignment when he served as <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2012/09/editorsmessage/what-you-see">Guest Critic</a> in September of 2012. Titled &ldquo;What You See&rdquo; it challenged writers to:</p>
<p>1. Write about what you see without mentioning any facts of a physical or technical nature. The terms of the work may be communicated as pure meaning or emotion, philosophy or politics. A poem or story is fair enough, or indeed anything that comes to mind, allowing that what is in the critic&rsquo;s head is part of the situation of the work.</p>
<p>2. Write about what you see mentioning only the physical and or technical aspect of it, without interpretation. (This needs no further guidelines.)</p>
<p>As seeing is a form of thinking, I would like to add the words <em>think</em>, <em>feel</em>, <em>hear</em> to &ldquo;see&rdquo; as obviously, some art is not about seeing. This month we are fortunate to begin with an <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2018/09/1by1/For-Bill-Berkson">homage to Bill Berkson</a> by the prolific, funny, writer Andrei Codrescu, followed by a <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2018/09/1by1/Richard-SerraTilted-Arc">timely thought-piece</a> on Richard Serra&rsquo;s <em>Tilted Arc</em> by frequent <em>Rail</em> contributor Nicole Miller.</p>
