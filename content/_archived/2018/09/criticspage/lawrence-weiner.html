<p>I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN MANY EXHIBITIONS WITH LUCIANO AND I AM ALWAYS EXCITED BY THE FACT THAT HE COULD TURN TINSEL INTO SUBSTANCE</p>
<p>MY RELATIONSHIP WITH LUCIANO WENT ON FOR MANY YEARS BUT I THINK THE HEIGHT OF IT FOR BOTH OF US WAS HELPING TO HOST YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE FALL OF THE WALL</p>
<p>WE WERE ABLE TO SEGUE YOUNG PEOPLE INTO A SYSTEM THEY HAD BEEN CLOSED OFF FROM</p>
<p>LUCIANO&rsquo;S SKILL AS A TEACHER AND MY ENTHUSIASM SEEMED TO MESH VERY WELL</p>
