title: 'Quotation, Paraphrase, and Plagiarism: An Exchange'
---

<br>
<p>Dear Field Notes,</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just seen&nbsp;Pavlos Roufos&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;The Aggressiveness of Vulnerability,&rdquo; in the July 2018<em> Brooklyn Rail</em>, which is partly a response to our two pieces on Angela Nagle&rsquo;s <em>Kill All Normies</em>. Unfortunately, we think the piece misrepresents our arguments, to the point of attributing quotes to us that aren&rsquo;t in the pieces cited. </p>
<p>For example, Roufos asserts that &ldquo;libcom&rsquo;s post &lsquo;informed&rsquo; its readers that Nagle&rsquo;s book is &lsquo;laughing at the alt-Right&rsquo;s scapegoats,&rsquo; that she has performed a &lsquo;leftist laundering of sexual assault,&rsquo; that she is transphobic and, essentially, a rape apologist.&rdquo; In fact, the phrase &ldquo;leftist laundering of sexual assault&rdquo; appears nowhere in our articles, nor is it a paraphrase. The only mention of laundering is: &ldquo;The right&rsquo;s successful creation of a moral panic around campus free speech may in fact be a good illustration of a &lsquo;Gramscian strategy&rsquo; (<em>KAN</em>, p. 98) of setting the political agenda through media and culture. But rather than critique this fabricated moral panic, <em>KAN</em>&rsquo;s dubiously sourced analysis gives it a leftist laundering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We specifically did not claim a leftist laundering of sexual assault (or rape apologism), but claimed that dubious sourcing results in a laundering of right-wing campus free speech moral panics. Given that this section is complaining that we&rsquo;ve accused someone of doing something they haven&rsquo;t, it seems ironic to fabricate statements from us in order to make the claim. We&rsquo;d appreciate a correction in this case.</p>
<p>Additionally, from another footnote: &ldquo;The irony of claiming to be influenced by the Situationist International while at the same time accusing someone of plagiarism would be merely embarrassing if it wasn&rsquo;t sad.&rdquo; This does not mention that the article in question says &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t really give a shit about plagiarism as such.&rdquo; Rather, the issue is how poor citations are used to make claims which &ldquo;either do not stand up to scrutiny, or simply repeat alt-right narratives about themselves as Nagle&rsquo;s own analysis&rdquo; (see&nbsp;https://libcom.org/blog/angela-nagles-plagiarise-any-nonsense-03052018).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of bad-faith mischaracterization of our arguments by Nagle supporters; most we&rsquo;ve ignored but decided to respond here due to the egregiousness of just making up a quote, and because your site is more reputable than most.</p>

<p><strong>Pavlos Roufos Replies</strong></p>
<p>Libcom&nbsp;claims that I misrepresented their arguments against Angela Nagle in my article, &ldquo;The Aggressiveness of Vulnerability.&rdquo; Something like that is always possible and mistakes should be corrected. This is not such a case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libcom&nbsp;provides two examples of my alleged misrepresentation: The first, accusing me of &ldquo;attributing quotes to [libcom] that aren&rsquo;t in the pieces cited,&rdquo; concerns the following statement from my article:&nbsp;<em>libcom&rsquo;s post &ldquo;informed&rdquo; its readers that Nagle&rsquo;s book is &ldquo;laughing at the alt-Right&rsquo;s scapegoats,&rdquo; that she has performed a &ldquo;leftist laundering of sexual assault,&rdquo; that she is transphobic and, essentially, a rape apologist.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, what&nbsp;libcom&nbsp;takes issue with is merely one phrase in this passage,&nbsp;&ldquo;<a name="_GoBack"></a>leftist laundering of sexual assault.&rdquo; I admit that this sentence does not appear&nbsp;<em>as such</em>&nbsp;in the article and should therefore not have been put inside quotation marks. What does appear in&nbsp;libcom&rsquo;s post is the charge that &ldquo;rather than critique this&nbsp;fabricated moral panic, <em>KAN</em>&rsquo;s dubiously sourced analysis gives it a leftist laundering.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>But what exactly is this&nbsp;&ldquo;fabricated moral panic&rdquo; that Nagle&nbsp;&ldquo;laundered&rdquo; for the left? </p>
<p>In the same part of the article from which the above passage is taken,&nbsp;libcom&nbsp;argues that Nagle&nbsp;&ldquo;omits the substantive issue of sexual assault entirely,&rdquo; an accusation repeated in the next paragraph. Then, directly before the &ldquo;leftist laundering&rdquo; passage, they write: &ldquo;What does a complaint about an invited speaker in Cardiff have to do with the fallout of a sexual assault in Illinois? How are such scattered incidents parlayed into a transatlantic crisis of campus free speech? Any material analysis here would need to at least discuss the asymmetric nature of a culture war which pits well-funded professional pundits (such as&nbsp;<u>Turning Point USA</u>&nbsp;and their professorial watchlist, or the aforementioned Spiked and its UK university free speech rankings) against unpaid student activists&#151;and often specific individual students protesting bigotry, harassment or assault<em>.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This is, then, the actual content given (by&nbsp;libcom, not me) to the&nbsp;&ldquo;fabricated moral panic.&rdquo; The issue of &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; is mentioned at least four times in the immediately preceding paragraphs, which go through a number of controversies before concluding that all the above can be summed up as the Right&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;fabricated moral panic.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>So even though I agree that the sentence&nbsp;&ldquo;leftist laundering of sexual assault&rdquo; should not have been given as a direct quotation, it is pretty obvious that only someone who cannot read (or understand what they write) could claim that the&nbsp;&ldquo;fabricated moral panic&rdquo; of the Right is not related to the issue of&nbsp;&rdquo;sexual assault&rdquo;, which Nagle is accused of&nbsp;&ldquo;laundering.&rdquo; Paraphrasing is not the same as quoting, I grant that, but complaining about misplaced quotation marks or bad citations is not the same as radical critique either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second example of misrepresentation concerns my assertion that it&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>would be embarrassing, if it wasn&rsquo;t sad&rdquo;</em> for a website that claims to be influenced by the Situationist International to complain about plagiarism.&nbsp;Libcom&rsquo;s letter to the <em>Rail</em> points out that they explicitly say in their article that they&nbsp;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t really give a shit about plagiarism.&rdquo; I have to admit that I was particularly puzzled by this complaint. One is forced to wonder why someone who&nbsp;&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about plagiarism&rdquo;&nbsp;would repeatedly accuse Nagle of precisely that in the&nbsp;libcom&nbsp;(or individual administrators&rsquo;) twitter exchanges. What is even more difficult to comprehend is why someone who&nbsp;&ldquo;does not really give a shit about plagiarism&rdquo; would title their article &ldquo;Angela Nagle&rsquo;s&nbsp;Plagiarize&nbsp;Any Nonsense.&rdquo; But even if&nbsp;libcom&nbsp;likes to pretend that its exchanges on&nbsp;twitter or its article&nbsp;titles&nbsp;are irrelevant, the situation is actually worse. Their very explanation of what they mean when they&nbsp;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t give a shit about plagiarism,&rdquo; is a very peculiar (and quite clearly&nbsp;<em>anti</em>-Situationist) definition of plagiarism: for&nbsp;libcom, we read, plagiarism is ok when related to&nbsp;news events; if &ldquo;19 news sources have a similar account of that event, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make any difference which source you use as the basis of your own writing&#151;they&rsquo;ve probably copied it from another source themselves anyway.&rdquo; Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of the Situationist embrace of plagiarism would find libcom&rsquo;s approach&nbsp;&ldquo;embarrassing, if it wasn&rsquo;t sad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>My article&rsquo;s key criticism of libcom&nbsp;was that their &ldquo;critique&rdquo; of Nagle&rsquo;s book (and of her as a person) proceeds through the filters of identitarianism, which leads them to present her as a veritable monster. There is no critique of the&nbsp;content&nbsp;of Nagle&rsquo;s book but instead an academic-style complaint about bad citations and insinuations&nbsp;about her motives and her &ldquo;real political beliefs,&rdquo; such as her views on rape, sexual assault, and transgender issues. Instead of responding to my arguments, libcom complains about misplaced quotation marks, while presenting a very unusual understanding of the notion of plagiarism. Perhaps nothing else is needed to indicate their inability to read (or even write) properly but I cannot resist the temptation of mentioning that at the end of their letter they call me a &ldquo;supporter of Nagle&rdquo; . . . I rest my case.</p>
