<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Simplicity is the essential objective. Deceptively trouble-free<br>
And unobtainable. How can one be fast but not hurry?
This fancy has been there from the get go. Quintessential
Instances like <em>Two boys</em>, <em>Street Scene Balloons</em>,
<em>Jack&rsquo;s Fancy Fruit Vegetable</em>. Fabulous leap, tender negotiation
With space beneath the basket in the seventh game of the
NBA Finals. No one can predict the three-point dagger
Or windmill dunk. Standing ovation, full-capacity crowd.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">All this happened before Camden became a backwater&rsquo;s<br>
Backwater. Ada stands at the central axis of <em>Bather, </em>reassuring
The platform of earth its worth to the sea&rsquo;s immensity.
<em>Clamdigger at Ducktrap</em>, especially <em>Blueberry Field</em>,
Acrobatic choreography of dancing brushstrokes prevails
Long before Paul Taylor entered the scene. Suspecting speed before
It becomes aspect like breezy tone, as Frank O&rsquo;Hara would
Write in his lunch poem, &ldquo;My heart is in my pocket.&rdquo;
Elsewhere, everyone notices how Ada lends her smiles to
Every climate of environment, be it social in Manhattan or natural
In Lincolnville, Maine.
Gazing at <em>Irving and Lucy</em>, their wedding gift in 1958,
Followed by <em>Rudy and Edith</em>, say
<em>At 4 pm</em>,
Alex&rsquo;s haiku cubism was already underway. Urbane acumen.
Swift gestures. Edges never fuzzy, razor-sharp
Like the samurai&rsquo;s sword,
Never fails to rehearse each duel.</p>
