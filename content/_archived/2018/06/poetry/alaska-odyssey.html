<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sing to me of Alaska, O Muse! Sing of treasured languages,</p>
<p>Heard only by the Ancients! Sing of languages rising,</p>
<p>Ever to be heard!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&ntilde;upiaq, Siberian Yup&rsquo;ik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik,</p>
<p>Alutiiq, Unangax, Dena'ina, Deg Xinag, Holikachuk,</p>
<p>Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Gwich'in, Tanana,</p>
<p>Upper Tanana, Tanacross, H&auml;n, Ahtna, Eyak,</p>
<p>Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear Tlingit! Here Juneau!</p>
<p>Nora Marks Dauenhauer! X&#817;&rsquo;unei Lance Twitchell!</p>
<p>Speaking/recording poems and stories that never end.</p>
<p>Nora in her 90&rsquo;s speaking Tlingit&ndash; essence poetry!</p>
<p>Lance, in his 30&rsquo;s with 3 children under the age of 6,</p>
<p>Studies for Linguistics PhD in Hawai&rsquo;i --</p>
<p>His kids will learn Tlingit in a school he will create</p>
<p>Like the P&#363;nana Leo that Larry Kimura, Kauanoe Kamana,</p>
<p>And Pila Wilson and others started in Hilo!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear Juneau story of linguist Alice Taff</p>
<p>Teaching language as identity is health.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know who you are</p>
<p>You wander a lost landscape,</p>
<p>Try to find yourself in alcohol and addiction.</p>
<p>Speaking your Mother Tongue, you know who you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sing, Juneau! Woosh Kinaadeiyi poetry slam!</p>
<p>Reading with Nora at Christy NaMee Ericksen&rsquo;s Kindred Post</p>
<p>Juneau, glacier clutching mountains, Tlingit is rising!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear I&ntilde;upiaq! Here in Kotzebue!</p>
<p>Obama is my advance man, his visit just two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Tim Aqukkasuk Argestsinger, NANA language activist says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use is your language being &lsquo;official&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here where tundra meets sea, a hundred miles from Russia,</p>
<p>A poetry workshop at the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center,</p>
<p>With three Elders and the poems of Joan Naviyuk Kane</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barrow, northernmost point of US!</p>
<p>Snowstorms sweep in September!</p>
<p>I arrive on first day of whaling season. Auspicious!</p>
<p>Three bowheads are brought in, maximum daily catch,</p>
<p>Will feed three extended families through the entire winter.</p>
<p>On the beach, the animals are treated with respect, I&ntilde;upiaq spoken,</p>
<p>Passed from one generation to the next, as life itself</p>
<p>Is carried on. Or you can pay $20 for a 5lb bag of potatoes.</p>
<p>Language Matters is screened at the town&rsquo;s living room,</p>
<p>Tuzzy Public Library, David Ongley, Culture Warrior, Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, Fairbanks! The story: Allan Hayton,</p>
<p>Speaking to me in Gwich&rsquo;in because he must speak</p>
<p>Aloud to keep the sounds alive in his ears.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Immersion Class, he says one day.</p>
<p>So we visit a woman and her two children.</p>
<p>Allen sets a timer for an hour.</p>
<p>For an hour the children hear Gwich&rsquo;in only</p>
<p>Smiling in the language of who they are</p>
<p>Ready for a chapter in Leanne Hinton&rsquo;s Bringing</p>
<p>Our Languages Home (Heyday, 2013).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div class="photogallery">!!img1!!</div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairbanks! Moose stew and caribou meat!</p>
<p>Singing church hymns in Gwich&rsquo;in</p>
<p>Yeendoo ji&rsquo; dhandaii danh</p>
<p>Zhik gw&#303;&#303;zhr&#303;&#303; nihtat ts&rsquo;at tiidadaa.</p>
<p>(In the sweet by and by</p>
<p>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairbanks! The university linguists are the people&rsquo;s linguists!</p>
<p>Hear the story of Larry Kaplan, Gary Holton, Siri Tuttle, all</p>
<p>Who see the continuation of Alaskan languages</p>
<p>Not as part of their job, but as the job itself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear the Poetry Slam, multi-culti, futuristic! Hail Effie Kokrine Charter School!</p>
<p>And here the story of poetry workshop at Fairbanks Youth Facility,</p>
<p>Poems blaze freedom for these young men, poems as salvation,</p>
<p>Hip hop bravado next to a poem of silence</p>
<p>And waiting while on a bear hunt. Where is my language? ask the young poets.</p>
<p>The language is silent and waiting. Poetry holds a place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here in the wilds,</p>
<p>Hear the story of tiny prop plane dropping me off in Arctic Village,</p>
<p>Where I sleep on Gwich&rsquo;in Immersion Classroom floor,</p>
<p>The lights on a motion sensor</p>
<p>A blast of light every time I roll over</p>
<p>Waking me in a room of ghosts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear the tale of the new Caribou Fence, complete with website!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vgfn.ca/heritage/">http://www.vgfn.ca/heritage/</a> and video! <a href="https://vimeo.com/121193920The">https://vimeo.com/121193920</a></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/121193920The">The</a> project brings work to this village of 400</p>
<p>Brings history alive recreating ancient hunting method:</p>
<p>Funnel of felled trees direct caribou to hunters waiting with spears.</p>
<p>Gwich&rsquo;in words for caribou, for caribou fence, for strings-</p>
<p>Woven-in-air-to-catch-caribou-antlers</p>
<p>Bro, in his marijuana watch cap, rifle slung across his back,</p>
<p>Shows up near sunset -- he&rsquo;ll take me to caribou fence for gas money.</p>
<p>I climb behind him on his muddy four-wheeler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been told the fence is just a short way out of town,</p>
<p>But we make our way into the wilderness, pine trees dotting</p>
<p>Frozen landscape, crunching &lsquo;cross ice creeks, half-frozen lakes,</p>
<p>Snow drifting silence and solitude, true Alaska and still traveling 45 minutes later</p>
<p>I worry about getting back in time to show the movie, sun lowering,</p>
<p>Cold draping my body. We reach a hill where under snow the trail</p>
<p>Is solid ice. The 4-wheeler slides, I get off, we must walk. No,</p>
<p>I say, we must return, the Caribou Fence will be a mirage of history.</p>
<p>I freeze on the long return, when Bro, nearing the village,</p>
<p>Rifle bumping against my chest, turns and shouts,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to have your photo taken?&rdquo; I laugh. He seems the last guy,</p>
<p>This the last place, to suggest a photo opportunity. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ndash;what?! There it is, just off the trail, just out of town -- the Caribou Fence!</p>
<p>The one Allan told me about, a living recreation of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is it!&rdquo; I shout, &ldquo;What I wanted to see! the Caribou Fence itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Bro shrugs, &ldquo;thought you meant the Old Caribou Fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear the story of the $25 door prize. 15 people have a chance at the prize,</p>
<p>Arctic Village premier of Language Matters. People ask questions. I press</p>
<p>Spacebar, stop film to discuss Last Speaker of Amardak in Australia, say.</p>
<p>We all have popcorn. Sarah James, Gwich&rsquo;in spokesperson, so eloquent</p>
<p>On home turf. Again fitfully I sleep in Gwich&rsquo;in classroom</p>
<p>Harsh motion detector Morse code light, SOS SOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear Fort Yukon radio station story</p>
<p>DJ Vera Englishoe loves to speak her Gwich&rsquo;in</p>
<p>But only does so because I ask her to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Homer, the town! I become poet here! Give readings, show new poem-film,</p>
<p>Khonsay: Poem of Many Tongues, 50 languages in 15 minutes,</p>
<p>Hail! Bunnell Street Gallery! I read poems as whales breach out window.</p>
<p>Visit Nikolaevsk, Old Russian Village, another language in Alaska&rsquo;s crown!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hear Eyak! Tales of Anna Nelson Harry</p>
<p>Lovingly recorded/translated by linguist Michael Krauss,</p>
<p>Now all that&rsquo;s left. Last Speaker died 2008, but no one told the Legislature,</p>
<p>So Eyak is still an official Alaskan language, even though no one speaks it.</p>
<p>Not true! A French teenager is learning -- hears Eyak in his dreams,</p>
<p>Like Jesse little doe Baird, reviving Wampanoag in Cape Cod,</p>
<p>A language unspoken spoken for a hundred years</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Kodiak Island, site of Alutiiq Museum!</p>
<p>Sugpiag, an Alutiiq nation, speaking that tongue!</p>
<p>Today mixed in with Tagalog-speaking Filipino population, some</p>
<p>Ilocano as well, some Thai. The fishing industry and brand-new brewery!</p>
<p>Poetry and language feted in the Library! Here&rsquo;s to April Councellar</p>
<p>And Michael Bach at the Museum! To Katie Baxter at the Library!</p>
<p>The grand mix of Kodiak!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the story of City of Anchorage, Alaskan Federation</p>
<p>Of Natives Convention, thousands of Alaskans celebrating native</p>
<p>Heritage and languages. The power of these peoples inherent, inside the dances</p>
<p>Smiles of greetings cross cultures of the state.</p>
<p>Mutual support for struggle of identity, culture, language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2003 Alaska voted to have an Official Language: English.</p>
<p>It took eleven years for legislature to add twenty more, the indigenous languages</p>
<p>That have been here &ldquo;forever&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ch'a tl&aacute;kwd&aacute;x si. &aacute;at, tl&eacute;l ch'as y&aacute; t&aacute;akw&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Bill passed, April 2014, but a cynical government waited for AFN Convention</p>
<p>To sign it, so Governor gets publicity bump.</p>
<p>And of course, no money to support language continuity.</p>
<p>So it is done -- without money nor support of any government.</p>
<p>And it was here -- not uncommon at AFN -- someone jumped</p>
<p>Off roof of Convention Center into a future without language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Anchorage, walk Tidal Trail with Joan Naviyuk Kane,</p>
<p>Hearing her story, years working for an actual trip to Ugiuvak (King Island),</p>
<p>With helicopters and boats and a crew of shared-vision women:</p>
<p>In dreams begin responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, Alaska, country of languages!</p>
<p>Language Revolution Future where the horrors of the past</p>
<p>Are made right with simple respect for Mother Tongues&rsquo;</p>
<p>Knowledge, Identity, Wisdom. Lives (and money) saved</p>
<p>By reviving languages! Identity pays that bottom line!</p>
<p>Here, Alaska waits, poised to be Center of Global Language Revolution!</p>
