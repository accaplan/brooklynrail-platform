<p align=justify>Ancient viruses entombed in permafrost reanimate in a thaw, but I believe in restorative justice. I work odd-jobs and keep strange hours REM-embering entrapment deoxygenates like microbial reservoir. Dormant morpheme geometrizes into packing ice, that ungodly uniformed authority melting as heat spirals toward the method of measure. Once, a poet said to me, &ldquo;As a prison abolitionist, I don&rsquo;t believe in public shaming, I believe in restorative justice, reforming our abusers.&rdquo; Only death can stop my undertaking. As wraith, I wanted to smack the light out of that person. </p>

<p align=justify>After the sump pump replacement &amp; effacing black mold, I slept between six doors to sunken places. October 14-18, 2010, apnea animates four consecutive nights of auto-asphyxia: from the basement&rsquo;s back entrance, where flood rushed wholly tomes of water; from the basement&rsquo;s back entrance, where flood rushed wholly tomes of water widening its wild cat eyes into horizon fire; one-into-two height halved unholy approaching reticently, as if in inquiry, and abhorrent of flesh; in the basement&rsquo;s back entrance, where flood rushed wholly tomes of water widening its wild cat eyes into horizon fire, no, into nova, mouthing growls, protracting its appendages into my shoulders like a father. <em>O</em>, its name, widening in concentric aura, <em><del>my name is</del> O</em>, over and over, as if to offer another way.</span></p>

<p align=justify>&ldquo;The closest to absolute darkness that can be manufactured&rdquo; I look upon you dead-eyed knowing that it&rsquo;s over. The last time I gazed into the person who should have killed me, the room could hear our deep exhaling&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;so told&mdash;out of body, then, my mind for violence&mdash;a violent squall. No, darkness is not so sacred that it cannot be reengineered. To hack a biome of a million carbon filaments&mdash;in my memories, I cannot see their faces, the children&mdash;but the one who witnesses as I break each bystander with my treble, no, troubles and trembling. I make my stand as a light storm dissipates into nothing. Trapped between each carbon print. Doof judge. Fucking dumbass judge. Dumbass me. Ambient heat energy in a row of text&mdash;his family glaring at me from the back of the room as newer entities of my spirit dominated the entire court.</p>

<p>[Plea Deal]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the likelihood of actually receiving this fellowship is nonexistent, because fellows often have certain accolades and publications in common &amp; I know having a book out with a great press is only a boon in this process&hellip; but not all &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; poets prioritize publishing a book, or garnering esteem or social capital. To me, craft and voice are in community &amp; it is in their defense, in the face of erasure and insult, in which I persist. It is not self-sabotage, I am simply trying to evade discovery. Truthfully, I&rsquo;m cognizant of the fact that I was never the right candidate. Hopefully, this year, the evidence of my insurgency might somehow slip through all your vetting.&rdquo;</p>

<p align=justify>Today, I am reading a deerskin&rsquo;s underside, tracing my fingernail along derma until it teaches me something of fresh shoots and panting. I&rsquo;m pawing dust bunnies around the base of my bedroom altar thinking, sight that does not touch is not seeing. </p>
<p align=justify>Redaction teaches me to trap spirits in cracked glass&mdash;this broken obsidian dagger will do&mdash;mirrors refracting light at strange angles. Magma ripples tamped into solid-state, I apply several seals against sun-worship, disentangling azimuths, like, with my hand.</p>
<p align=justify>I used to see a therapist, but now I just openly issue whispers to the shadows; of each death forms of I a phantom&mdash;what is consciousness? Is it not haunting a space apart from flesh or a part in partitioned space as flesh? Sounds outside time pleading in the brick dimness of its grouty recesses despite the bright of day? </p>
<p align=justify>My neck hurts where you never stabbed me, apparitional experiences as true as flaming circle, as entrusting in spiritual stamina and a whispered directive, <em>you must steal the fires tattooing filched land</em>. </p>
