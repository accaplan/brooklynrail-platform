<p align=center>His hand skates.<br>
Occasional, randomized spotted stains,
Primal calligraphy, palimpsests of East Village graffiti,
Among other common urban amplitudes,
With a somewhat constant speed on the explicit visual field.
He tinkers his-so-distinctive graphic impulse.</p>
<p align=center>A pair of male nudes wrestle and fight<br>
<em>Any Day at Dusk on Green Hills of Earth.</em>
Someone near me says far out!
She&#146;s thinking aloud, fasten your alliances:
Mantegna&rsquo;s magnificent engravings <em>Battle of the Sea Gods,</em>
Pollaiuolo&rsquo;s <em>Combat between Naked Men,</em>
It&rsquo;s the perception of struggle, not of fighting, that matters.</p>
<p align=center>Theatrical repertoire willfully overturns physiognomic expression.<br>
Between parts of the stylized body,
Solidarity dancing with agility, strange forms frolicking
Under the disguise of spheres and cylinders,
The human figure&mdash;in this neck of the woods&mdash;
Is impersonally personal; he has renounced
Any sentimental value a long time ago.</p>
<p align=center>This industrial,<br>
Jazzy assembly of expansive gestures,
Welded with bold, elemental characterizations
Of contained images in black delineations,
Has its own terms of endearment
And basic views of monumentality.
A large foreground with a generous curvature, a horizon in some,
Is either a jocular bloodbath or
An alluring homoerotic <em> pas de deux</em>
In between <em>agony and ecstasy.</em></p>
<p align=center>Foreshortened nudes, seen from front and back, are left dead<br>
Through night and day. Hovering bird, clapping its wings,
Frozen in her countenance before declaring<em> things are strange.</em></p>
