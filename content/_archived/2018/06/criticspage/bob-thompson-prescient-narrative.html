title: 'Bob Thompson, prescient narrative'
---

!!img1!!<p>It was as a graduate student in an art history class taught by Irving Sandler that I became familiar with 10th Street painting. Bob Thompson&rsquo;s work stood out&mdash;it was vibrant and immediate. My interest was subsequently reinforced when I met Ellen Phelan and her friend Susanne Hilberry, who were both involved with the work through the Morris Gallery in Detroit. Paula Cooper&mdash;who had shown the work during the Paula Johnson days&mdash;had a beautiful, very replete gouache, which I bought or traded for. It had a level of emotionality that to some extent corresponded with my own fears and ambitions, and the nature of some of my earliest shows.</p>
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s painting was the antithesis of what was being exhibited in most of the galleries, where Pop, Color Field painting, and Minimalism were dominant. I was young and trying to come to terms with my own art, investigating process, questioning certain aspects of Minimalism, and exploring the possibility of figuration. I was intrigued by the work&rsquo;s vividness as well as its re-contextualization of renaissance painting, the blunt cooption of imagery with little detail. He made the old masters immediate and current&mdash;no longer ecclesiastical but ecstatic, and occasionally frightening. <em>L&rsquo;Execution</em> (1961), a small painting based on Fra Angelico&rsquo;s <em>Martyrdom of Saints Cosmas and Damian</em>, elevates the kneeling saint about to be decapitated into a lynching victim. Beheaded figures are still on the ground and a group of people are watching, unmoved by the horror before them.&nbsp;</p>
