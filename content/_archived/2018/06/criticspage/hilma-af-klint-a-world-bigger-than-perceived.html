<p>How do you make a painting when it is not about paint?<br />How do you put words to the unseen and the invisible? <br />Hilma, the conduit of the unseen and invisible.<br />Channeled by the simultaneously visible and invisible finger a medium of higher forces painted through her contacting a world bigger than perceived.<br />Guided by higher levels of consciousness to explore a world and how it is connected.<br />Swans, Doves, and Angels inhabit her world.<br />Her mission was to open our eyes to a life that lasts for eternity.<br />Limiting her own free lofty flights of thought in order to give vision a form that others can understand.</p>
