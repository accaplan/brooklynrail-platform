!!img1!!<p>Refinement can be crude. Consider a fine patchwork grid of fields that wave across the landscape&mdash;beautiful, abstract&mdash;always a wonder to see from an aircraft. Their precise borders also display the demarcation of ownership and the pacification of wilderness. Separated plots preserve a crop from invasive plants, yet monocultures deplete the soil&rsquo;s nutrients. Maintenance is toil. The paintings of Myron Stout indicate that reduction and order do not translate into simplification or claims on moral clarity; the painter understood that meeting places are pressurized, and accumulated his strokes into thickenings along them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Stout&rsquo;s great works, the black and white ones you can&rsquo;t classify as &ldquo;geometric abstraction,&rdquo; the whites shift from painting to painting&mdash;sometimes layered and smooth, sometimes thick and cakey, or thick and dabbed&mdash;always different, &ldquo;for the painting comes to life for me in the vibration, so to speak, of the heights and depths of the texture.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> Vibration of this sort is like light flicker on an ocean&rsquo;s scalp, you see the surface but feel the swell. Painting a pulse does not require any particular mode of handling or even image; it requires awareness.</p>
<p>Stout&rsquo;s black is generally deadpan flat. Combined with white, the two colors oscillate spatially. The drawing bends in and out, becomes a profile of slopes and valleys, or an aerial view of a lung expanded. They are monumental in the way a brain in the skull is, snug but not squished, powerful. He worked in an era when purity was a realistic interest&mdash;now a dated notion; they hold up because they&rsquo;re not trying to be pure.</p>
<p>From his <em>Journals</em>, in the rare use of the exclamation point, Stout wrote: &ldquo;To see openly, frankly!&rdquo;<sup>2</sup> The absence of affect is refreshing as style.<sup>3</sup></p>
