<em>Vernon Subutex 1</em>  
translated by Frank Wynne (MacLehose Press, 2017)</p>
!!img1!!<p>&ldquo;Life is often a game of two halves,&rdquo; thinks Vernon Subutex, the hapless character at the center of Virgine Despentes&rsquo;s virtuosic <em>Vernon Subutex 1. </em>&ldquo;In the first half it lulls you, makes you think you&rsquo;re in control; in the second, when it sees you&rsquo;re relaxed and helpless, it comes around again and grinds you to a pulp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This quote could easily apply to the structure of the Ana&iuml;s Nin Prize-winning, Man Booker International-shortlisted <em>Vernon Subutex 1. </em>The first half of the novel sets out in a straightforward enough manner: we meet Vernon Subutex, a middle-aged man immobilized with apathy and debt. After his business&mdash;a Parisian record store called Revolver&mdash;shutters in 2006, he finds himself unemployable: &ldquo;his chances of finding work were slimmer than if he had been a coalminer.&rdquo; He manages to keep his apartment for seven or eight years, both by living off a frugal diet of rice and hand rolled cigarettes and by turning to his friend Alexandre Bleach, a mega-famous pop star, to pay his rent.</p>
<p>But then Alexandre Bleach dies of an overdose and Vernon Subutex is evicted. He lands on the street carrying only a backpack and tapes of an interview the drug-addled Alexandre Bleach conducted with himself. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, like, my last will and testament, man, you get it?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Vernon is the anti-parvenu, and what follows is less of his fall from grace than a pachinko-ing towards rock bottom. He reaches out to everyone he knows from the salad days of Revolver and Alexandre Bleach&rsquo;s height of fame, and begins couch-surfing with increasingly seedy acquaintances. Word gets out, via an ambitious screenwriter and a ruthless film executive, about Alexandre Bleach&rsquo;s &ldquo;last will and testament,&rdquo; and soon a variety of Parisians, including a woman whose job it is to decimate online reputations and a journalist with the pen surname Bazooka, are on the hunt for Vernon Subutex.</p>
<p>The novel&rsquo;s first half is grim, luminous, and packed with stunning psychological insight, but it&rsquo;s contained enough to allow the reader to feel in control. You&rsquo;re lulled by the trajectory of the mystery&mdash;<em>what do those tapes reveal?&mdash;</em>and the chase. Then, the second half cartwheels off the course of the caper and twists into something darker and more exuberant.</p>
<p>While the point of view in initial chapters alternates dependably between Vernon and the people that give him a couch to sleep on, the number of characters in <em>Vernon</em> <em>Subutex </em>expands as news of Vernon&rsquo;s plight spreads across his Facebook friends&rsquo; newfeeds. Vernon Subutex is revealed as less a protagonist than a node at the center of a social matrix.</p>
<p><em>Vernon Subutex 1 </em>is the best novel we have about Facebook, and not just because its cast is a reflection of one man&rsquo;s &ldquo;friends list.&rdquo; Vernon&rsquo;s Facebook use propels the novel&rsquo;s forward momentum. Even while destitute, Vernon manages to hang on to a laptop, posting sentimental Youtube clips, gleaning likes from potential hosts, and approaching them on Messanger.</p>
<p>Facebook, market research tells us, is the playground of the graying set, including the Gen-X&rsquo;ers of <em>Vernon Subutex 1</em>. Pushing fifty, the central figures in <em>Vernon Subutex 1</em> are preoccupied with nostalgia, worrying about the decay of old age, and mirthlessly doing heroic amounts of cocaine. They&rsquo;re also convulsed in rage. We&rsquo;re given access to the people that populate Vernon&rsquo;s orbit for a chapter, at most two, and these chapters are written in the style so prevalent on Facebook: the anger-fueled rant.</p>
<p>Some of this rage is manifested in ugliness, hatred, and bigotry. An affluent family man simmers with barely-controlled xenophobia in the supermarket; a group of right-wing fanatics stroll the streets &ldquo;in battle formation,&rdquo; hopped up on an adreno-muscular stimulant called Napalm; a wife-beating Marxist states that he wouldn&rsquo;t commit domestic abuse if he was wealthier: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no professional future. If I quit being violent, when do I ever get to feel like I&rsquo;m the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women who populate <em>Vernon Subutex 1 </em>are, by and large, less full of bile (although one ex-junkie-turned-affluent-mother is cutting and &ldquo;[w]hat she most appreciates about her girlfriends is the ability to rip them apart once their backs are turned.&rdquo; But they&rsquo;re no less filled with rage. There&rsquo;s Emilie, who&rsquo;s learning the art of being selfish in middle age: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sick and tired of fucking poets. Of guys too sensitive to put in a day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s A&iuml;cha, deeply religious and grappling with the fact that her mother used to be a porn star.</p>
<p><em>Vernon Subutex 1</em>, had it simply chronicled a cross-section of Parisian life circa 2013-14, could have read like an eloquent time capsule. Instead, it&rsquo;s a brilliant, blistering social novel that&rsquo;s only become more relevant since its initial 2015 publication. <em>Vernon Subutex</em> touches upon the increasing precariousness and invaluableness of the personal brand, the spread of misinformation online, and the rise of the right wing populism. Prescience can sound ponderous; in Despentes&rsquo; hands it&rsquo;s wry: &ldquo;Xavier was always a right-wing cunt. He has not changed, it is simply that the world is now aligned with his obsessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The translation, by the award-winning Frank Wynne (best known for his translations of Michel Houellebecq), uses Anglicisms that make the dry wit of <em>Vernon Subutex 1</em> sound especially deadpan to American ears. In a dizzying, brilliant chapter (the English translation of which was initially excerpted in <em>The White Review</em>) a coked-up finance bro slings phrases like &ldquo;He nearly lost his rag,&rdquo; and &ldquo;piss-poor excuse about not having his gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Vernon Subutex 1 </em>is the first of a trilogy; the English translation of <em>Vernon Subutex 2 </em>will be published in June. In Europe, the books have transformed Despentes&rsquo;s literary reputation from respected cult icon&mdash;of titles like the feminist revenge novel <em>Baise-moi</em> and the Prix Renaudot-awarded <em>Apocalypse b&eacute;b&eacute;&mdash;</em>to bestselling author. Despentes continues to grapple with the themes&mdash;gender, violence, cultural capital&mdash;that shaped her earlier books. Indeed, none of the audaciousness or anger of Despentes&rsquo;s previous work has been diluted in <em>Vernon Subutex 1. </em>It&rsquo;s just been expanded to encompass a wider cast.</p>
<p>The characters in <em>Vernon Subutex 1</em>, in all their livid ugliness, thrust the reader into unexpected empathy. Vernon is a hangdog Everyman even at his most cretinous, and the most unsavory of his hosts reveal anguish layered under their scar tissue. <em>Vernon Subutex</em> grinds you to a pulp, but it also exposes you to something urgently human. This is a vital novel.</p>
