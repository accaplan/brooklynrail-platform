<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lost Illusions</strong></p>
<br>

<p>&ldquo;No sense like license&rdquo;<br>
opens</p> 

<p>on a vast little plane of hostile wonders<br>
posited</p>

<p>as day or daylight<br>
by the scrub jay and her supporters</p>

<p>whose episodic memory is said to be a stunning<br>
contraption </p>

<p>like that woman we never knew<br>
where to go </p>

<p>or what to do when we got<br> 
there diligently copying the masters&#146;</p>

<p>habits<br>
for a few cents and a bed probably</p>

<p>blond or blind undecided<br>
leaving no stone unloved </p>

<p>ousters questers quitters all<br>
like butter in our determination</p>

<p>to never die and just go on ahead<br>
to fever</p>

<p>at some idiot <br>
nankeen trousers. Your realism</p>

<p>would send anyone to spasm. <br>
How dare</p>

<p>the service dog<br>
refuse to serve? </p>

<p>I will steal everything Old Navy has<br>
to offer and still</p>

<p>come up short<br>
in the unoriginal gargle of the wave</p>

<p>receding from the shore<br>
in the rough applause of pines</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve had enough of<br>
if and when</p>

<p>the wildfire attaches and<br>
possesses us</p>

<p>in its rush to ruin the tiny actresses <br>
who serve </p>

<p>to bring the play about <br>
under their curls</p>

<p>of smoke. That&rsquo;s a metaphor<br>
if I ever heard one. </p>

<p>like the line of mortal sweat<br>
you wake in</p>

<p>cast as duff<br>
you can&rsquo;t control</p>

<p>if the phone&rsquo;s too near its cradle<br>
to speak its piece. </p>

<p>The Uber comes to chase<br>
the Minotaur to his hedge</p>

<p>leaving us eccentric<br>
if exposed. </p>

<p>This is going nowhere. <br>
The excess peplums (plums, pearls) </p>

<p>from someone else&rsquo;s poem<br>
are just a distraction</p>

<p>How little we know<br>
about the <em>soup</em> that is served</p>

<p>at the daycare center<br>
Does it meet our needs? Wants? </p>

<p>Desires? Here deer are sparring<br>
to mate </p>

<p>We call this grabbing at straws<br>
with wooden spoons</p>

<p>but I don&rsquo;t hate speech<br>
just its bloody show</p>

<p>of fits<br>
when the going gets ecstatic</p>

<p>or rough<br>
I can&rsquo;t embody anything imagined</p>

<p>because nothing new is really nothing known <br>
especially when </p>

<p>nipple to nipple <br>
underwater</p>

<p>the gift of gram turns <br>
out a distraction&#151;or outright</p>

<p>loss of function<br>
(bowel, canal, commode) </p>

<p>I could take you anywhere<br>
and yet I choose</p>

<p>to prefer not to<br>
though I know I&rsquo;m not the first</p>

<p>to exile the dog<br>
against federal law</p>

<p>from the car when it arrives<br>
to take my body to science</p>

<p>and finds it&rsquo;s all <br>
full up</p>

<p>The early adopters<br>
have won the day</p>

<p>in squirrels, rats, and wrens<br>
when</p>

<p>were we not<br>
shown the way</p>

<p>to the hayloft? <br>
Say something. I could go on: </p>

<p>The slave university thinks it&rsquo;s brother<br>
to us all</p>

<p>not evolution&rsquo;s<br>
own conclusion for good</p>

<p>and all of us a meme<br>
next the ear</p>

<p>adhered to<br>
as the belly of content</p>

<p>from which it shall be rent. <br>
Why not state the obvious? </p>

<p>Hasters gotta haste. <br>
You wouldn&#146;t say you wouldn&rsquo;t stay</p>

<p>but swallowing the hay-<br>
seed became too difficult. </p>

<p>How much the past has come to define<br>
the present</p>

<p>when we call the clouds &ldquo;Turneresque&rdquo; <br>
in the middle of a gale. </p>

<p>I would have to read them <em>all<br>
over again</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>from &ldquo;Fallopian and What For&rdquo;</strong></p>
<br>
<p>When did the world first go to the dogs?</p>
<p>I mean when did the glacier take out the main PO</p>
<p>whose people long ago threw in</p>
<p>the towel? All the entrances to the tunnel</p>
<p>are flooded to keep us out</p>
<p>votes scattered behind sheets of PVC</p>
<p>There is nothing to be done in this version of history</p>
<p>as petrified forest</p>
<p>but scratch. We know time&#146;s lazy</p>
<p>collapse When latex snaps the bitter trees</p>
<p style="padding-left:150px">in half</p>
<p>Clouds attack.</p>
<p><em>What shall we do?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the players go the spoils</p>
<p>and the grass that writhes underfoot So</p>
<p>if in the transubstantiation of materials</p>
<p>zebras belong</p>
<p>to an odd-toed order</p>
<p>we turn fond of our systems but don&#146;t believe them</p>
<p>significant, aspiring to the church of quiet sanctuary</p>
<p>to witness, register, mother, who enters</p>
<p>if only to exclaim &#147;Mmm&#151;mine!&#148;</p>
<p>The proposition lasts longer than the chorus that greets it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see is to belong</p>
<p>to the genus chrysanthemum</p>
<p>hospitable if a little sour</p>
<p>getting no closer to the hour</p>
<p>when Trotula the doctor will be in.</p>
<p>For time travel is formal (story all one)</p>
<p>as horizons retreat repeating</p>
<p>into nights</p>
<p>when the animals come to lick at our feet</p>
<p>in the ER, the OR, and the rave</p>
<p>The egg ovarian arrives by Greyhound as a guest</p>
<p>disembarks confused</p>
<p>mistakes our vermin for pets</p>
<p>then bursts almost naturally</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>into unprotected</p>
<p>song. For everything inside the egg is personal</p>
<p>I couldn&#146;t stand aside if I wanted to</p>
<p>Meanwhile the scout returns with nothing to report</p>
<p>falls off her horse</p>
<p>Some women only want a love note to engorge</p>
<p>this foreknowledge of fate</p>
<p>Me, I bow like a break in the Oroville Dam</p>
<p>So multiples stand</p>
<p>at the spillway, <em>I</em></p>
<p>make stuff up but so do my friends,</p>
<p>cutwaters like gladiators</p>
<p>plowing the sea.</p>
<p>leaving it all behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like wishbones in the heraldry of dull afternoons</p>
<p>white bison glass over</p>
<p>the Last of Helena&#146;s Chances</p>
<p>Do you still want to go there</p>
<p>with your needle-nosed pliers trained in the shape of a hook?</p>
<p>Say yes.</p>
<p><em>Melania, blink if you need help.</em></p>
<p>The meal refuses to cook itself</p>
<p>The beaver tail will never be done</p>
<p>to our satisfaction</p>
<p>When the polar ice melts</p>
<p>the bears come into town</p>
<p>so hungry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For power sees itself coming.</p>
<p>You arrive by palfrey</p>
<p>but must sooner or later dismount</p>
<p>give up your purse to the riposte of compost</p>
<p>interpreted in dance by an ad hoc band</p>
<p>all big shoes and pleated skirts</p>
<p>What makes you think the Rostovs any happier</p>
<p>in their peasant getups</p>
<p>than Kadiddlehoppers in their bright rigs</p>
<p>eager themselves to take the stage?</p>
<p>It gives you pause because</p>
<p>arriving has to do with satisfaction beyond the status quo.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here the frame tale runs out of gas.</p>
<p>Citizen author stalls in her crusty cap</p>
<p>The ivy envelopes us in green twilight mesh</p>
<p>a lull in a tumult unless</p>
<p>we come up with a gist for this pulse</p>
<p>the nurse will soon be taking</p>
<p>hand over fist like the rope we pay out</p>
<p>to secure our place on the pile</p>
<p>I&#146;ve said it before and I&#146;ll say it again</p>
<p>The traffic on the rim has come to a halt</p>
<p>without satisfying our place in the world</p>
<p>If there&#146;s going to be trouble</p>
<p>You&#146;re my bitch now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I&#146;m the Queen of Sheba.</p>
<p>Meet me in St. Louis, Lois</p>
<p>we&#146;ll call ourselves <em>we</em> and take it from here</p>
<p>to Were you there</p>
<p>among the rubberneckers? When the saints came marching in?</p>
<p>If you think we don&#146;t suffer making paintings of suffering</p>
<p>Get your head examined by a cow in the labor of throes</p>
<p>whose headdress is a crow</p>
<p>deadname the deadnamer and hope</p>
<p>squatters don&#146;t follow</p>
<p>How it ends you don&#146;t</p>
<p>want to know</p>
<p>but <em>do</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
