<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my real live love interests are dead<br>
They are artists &amp; Latino &amp; dead
Not an epigram</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oh, That Brazilian Guy</strong><br>
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for H&eacute;lio Oiticica</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I ever see H&eacute;lio&#151;walking some part</p>
<p>East Village, curly headed and densely</p>
<p>Packed with art and drugs and death&#146;s</p>
<p>Constant shadow. Was he on the corner of</p>
<p>Avenue B and 10<sup>th</sup> Street drinking beer</p>
<p>And ogling the pretty Puerto Rican girls</p>
<p>Was he ogling me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or was he living in an abandoned warehouse</p>
<p>Holding on to his pencil, pen, brush on paper, cardboard,</p>
<p>Found trash or garment district fabric off loaded by a gang</p>
<p>Out of the projects whisking splatter of heroin (lost income)</p>
<p>Dropped dangling from a cup of bitch&#146;s brew</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, how to speculate this mad Hendrix loving</p>
<p>Artist&#146;s movements in El Barrio, Loisida or was he</p>
<p>Uptown, Spanish Harlem or on the West Side, Greenwich</p>
<p>Village, hanging with the drag queens early a.m. everybody</p>
<p>Tired from the bars, the piers, the crumbling edifices</p>
<p>Circa late 60s, early 70s <em>Nueva </em>York, <em>Nueva</em> York</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was on a wild ride the weed his stash the dazzled dreams</p>
<p>of men who had</p>
<p>Survived torture military repression a bad economy</p>
<p>Yet learned to take acid trips one day at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, the love affairs we have with the myth</p>
<p>Of, the what ifs and that drug paraphernalia</p>
<p>Oh, night seeker, ill named, moon winds</p>
<p>Your direction home?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus created this mixed up third whirl, loud music, your lips</p>
<p>Dry from screaming in January wind&#151;something mighty Hendrix</p>
<p>Sun lack</p>
<p>On a back meant for napping mid-day, heat exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the making of a hammock a thing of beauty,</p>
<p>Back lit by the gallerist</p>
<p>while duct tape coiled the rafters of some street legal post</p>
<p>Fly fishing flies</p>
<p>Pretended bait. Tight pants dropped here and there.</p>
<p>As thriving masquerade--of the handsome Brazilian</p>
<p>Who could have been the best <em>badnews</em> boyfriend ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>On the death of Claribel Alegria 1924-2018</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On earth, she marked her days with rage &amp; love</p>
<p>&amp; fought the generals and their army of thieves</p>
<p>&amp; torturers. Her pen was mighty, so also their</p>
<p>Arms. Death is the shadow twin, the one remaining</p>
<p>In the foothills, by the backdoor, in a convent, off</p>
<p>A mountainside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yet, a mother&#146;s breast awaits her infant&#146;s mouth.</p>
<p>A rooster crows and children gather what food there is</p>
<p>While bells ring across the foothills when the soldiers</p>
<p>Leave. A music of hope even as another child is buried</p>
<p>And a land mine erupts a few kilometers from hospital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We live in a time of suffering in places of beauty</p>
<p>Where the water and air meet in mountains dark-soiled</p>
<p>Food grows so effortlessly and so does greed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We live in a time of suffering in places of beauty</p>
<p>Where yesterday&#146;s rebel is today&#146;s president</p>
<p>And greed cowers the hurt children who hunger</p>
<p>Not only for their mother&#146;s milk but a safe place</p>
<p>Where peace storms the land with smiles</p>
<p>and the tender removal of all aspects of war</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A phantasm of peace. A peace unlike the other</p>
<p>Ones&#151;negotiated and then neglected, thus</p>
<p>Military rifles, handguns, machetes, bowie knives, unexploded landmines</p>
<p>All made so that peace will end and terror return</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you hear is the sea&#151;the heavy waves come in</p>
<p>Go out. Stars pattern&#151;Orion&#146;s belt or is that his heel?</p>
<p>And then another woman of letters departs, will she</p>
<p>Step on Orion&#146;s heel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would she say excuse me, I did not see your heel.</p>
<p>Would she try to hide her error as her celestial</p>
<p>Garments drag across the night sky. What if Orion</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could speak, and if he did, would he say, all the</p>
<p>Poets love my heel or my belt, you&#146;re not the first</p>
<p>To seek an anchor here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
