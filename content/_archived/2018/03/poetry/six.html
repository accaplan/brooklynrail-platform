<p><strong>START OVER</strong></p>
<br>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I spent a year on a farm<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trying not to freak out
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And holding food down</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Breathing and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remembering to breathe
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiting for the phone to ring </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door to knock <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or bust down 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But mostly smoking</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Listening to records <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fixing on small
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corners and edges</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Forgetting names for <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Colors and light and
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contrast that&#146;s distinct </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From sullen irony and glances <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And this week&rsquo;s been a rainy one
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there&rsquo;s a lot of great people</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In town and lots of lightning bugs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living with Chris old
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Habits new routines and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p><strong>WORDS</strong></p>
<p class="quote-attribution"><em>for Robert Creeley</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words are in the body<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The body is in the mind
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The big white cloud
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is in the sky</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stars are in the eye<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a butterfly
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On my finger</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heart is in the Bronx<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&rsquo;s &lsquo;nothing&rsquo; &lsquo;in&rsquo; Delaware
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brain is not the mind
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The future looks bright</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chance is in<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The forefoot
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The money&rsquo;s under</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The table<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The suitcase is on
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mattress
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because nothing</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Really mattress<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mistress
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has a mistress</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The numbers<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t add up
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The money talks
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The belly breathes</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words are in <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mouth
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tongue</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tickles the pizza<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the heart
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stays alive
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The finger</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is in the ear<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the other finger
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is in the other ear</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the dragon<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is in the mote
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And &lsquo;emotion&rsquo;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is the caption</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beneath the mote<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beneath the caption
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Below the words</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under the stars<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That breathe in 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A movie starring 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An actress</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twentieth century
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whose name escapes me </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p><strong>UP CLOSE</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the poets that has the best of everything<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the most that is a nothing better than a teaser
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A scroll made of paper a gold shiny piece of paper
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They shall walk by fries in summer by a jar of many ones 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got a picture of gum that&rsquo;s special 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because it&rsquo;s a piece of treasure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OKLAHOMA YAHOOS</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think I&rsquo;m going crazy <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this Jacuzzi
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the mesa </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pink lightning<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burnt sienna 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The year is 1977 </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And outlaw country <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is way past its prime
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;High as a kite </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cue takes you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Balls burst into flames 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because there&#146;s magic </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then there&rsquo;s <em>magic</em><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gasoline rainbows 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neon shimmer </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Acid rain on <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ordinary asphalt 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reminds me of you</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you&rsquo;re very far away <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I push the sky
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That holds me in</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p><strong>ASLEEP IN THE ATTIC</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Red, yellow, and green triangles <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon light school&rsquo;s a 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Disappointment flunking optical 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geometry flickering egg on summer</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Driving to the new age in a bathtub <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Full of junk after dark with a redneck 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hippie, an elegant photographer,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stokely Carmichael, George Wallace, SDS </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The notorious Country Joe interview<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do you do with the real magic
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of sixteen, false raga shirt and jeans
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tabula rasa in the shade won&rsquo;t stay</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because a point in space is a place <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For an argument insisting on emptiness 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When there&rsquo;s no mind left to treat
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Light moves slower through water than</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Air refracting what stays or appears to <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toss a pebble in the water of meaning 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And watch concentric circles form 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smooth as eyelids sure as uncertainty</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As natural as miscegenation a feeling <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That happens to get there then you
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arrive in a wild space material bliss
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ground shifts all the time as </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paradise must in every transformation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&#146;s a want for clarity in the roar of 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sense making like a shape you just made 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up one afternoon asleep in the attic</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><strong>A NEW KIND OF COUNTRY</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can&rsquo;t talk knife out of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feel like riding
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead a sweet dreams
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Inways indigo concede
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the cicadas
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feel like riding
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the cicadas</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the times <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t get it
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Earth rooms around a 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Camera call a satellite
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mingle like a natural
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t get it
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mingle like a natural</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About the chairs <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fold back in time
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With sirens always on
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ease by degree
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A head of curve
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fold back in time
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A head of curve</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Body&rsquo;s shape time <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;T-bird on tube
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pass the mind
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To your left brain
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scratch marks you back
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;T-bird on tube
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scratch marks you back</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motion as a verb<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sound not a word
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like wild jasmine
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A long way here
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which way is America
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sound not a word
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which way is America</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
