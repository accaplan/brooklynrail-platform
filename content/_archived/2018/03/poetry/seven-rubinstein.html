<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sigma Sound</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Face of the pop star</p>
<p>I look at trying</p>
<p>to discern in</p>
<p>his drug-drawn</p>
<p>androgyne mask</p>
<p>a map out</p>
<p>of my marriage.</p>
<p>&#147;Never no turning back&#148;</p>
<p>he sings unambiguously</p>
<p>from a Philadelphia studio</p>
<p>in nineteen-seventy-something,</p>
<p>my thin, white oracle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LISTS</strong></p>
<br>
<p>It&#146;s true: I don&#146;t</p>
<p>even know what</p>
<p>you taste like,</p>
<p>knowledge my tongue</p>
<p>-- alternately swimming</p>
<p>in the bubbling condensation</p>
<p>of desire and</p>
<p>dry with fear of</p>
<p>what temple-collapsing</p>
<p>chaos would ensue</p>
<p>if it did touch you</p>
<p>-- doesn&#146;t have.</p>
<p>Yet there&#146;s so much</p>
<p>I already know:</p>
<p>the list of traumas</p>
<p>physical conditions</p>
<p>and terrible failings</p>
<p>you have handed to me</p>
<p>and to which I have</p>
<p>so poorly replied with</p>
<p>any catalogue of my own</p>
<p>unscrubbable blemishes.</p>
<p>But your point was</p>
<p>how little any of</p>
<p>that matters</p>
<p>next to the</p>
<p>other kind of fact</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>added to our mutual list</p>
<p>only at the moment</p>
<p>delayed daily</p>
<p>with ever-increasing</p>
<p>difficulty</p>
<p>of contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THINGS I HAVE TIME FOR</strong></p>
<br>
<p>telling you what I think about the Joselit essays</p>
<p>telling you if I&#146;ve heard Yo La Tengo&#146;s album <em>Painful</em></p>
<p>and which track is my favorite</p>
<p>and whether we can make another poem-painting</p>
<p>and why I like &#145;60s figurative painting</p>
<p>but not the Leipzig School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#146;ve never heard <em>Painful</em></p>
<p>but I have a feeling that space</p>
<p>will soon open up for a listening session,</p>
<p>songs ferrying the meaning of its title</p>
<p>directly into me,</p>
<p>songs I haven&#146;t yet heard,</p>
<p>songs or what they represent,</p>
<p>the seizing emotions they&#146;re tagged with,</p>
<p>that I haven&#146;t listened to for a very long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Songs I haven&#146;t listened to for a very long time.</p>
<p>not because I didn&#146;t have the time</p>
<p>but because I didn&#146;t want</p>
<p>to listen to an album titled <em>Painful</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have the time to tell you</p>
<p>what I think about that,</p>
<p>except that I can&#146;t tell you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AND SO</strong></p>
<br>
<p>And so I have known</p>
<p>perfect union</p>
<p>and so I always will have known</p>
<p>perfect union</p>
<p>and so you and I will always have known it,</p>
<p>this miracle rescued</p>
<p>from our hundred years&#146; wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FOREST OF SYMBOLS</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Several months after Bowie&#146;s death,</p>
<p>driving through the city</p>
<p>I now think of as your city,</p>
<p>everything I see fills me with tenderness:</p>
<p>a backed-up intersection,</p>
<p>a chain pharmacy, a skyline</p>
<p>clogged with the leftover trophies</p>
<p>of forgotten oil booms.</p>
<p>This must be what it&#146;s like to inhabit a symbolist imagination.</p>
<p>Dipped in love, and surmounted by a tear-shaped flame.</p>
<p>I cue up <em>Station to Station</em> on my iPod.</p>
<p>On Studemont heading toward Washington</p>
<p>the opening riffs of &#147;Stay&#148; leap out of my Corolla&#146;s speakers</p>
<p>and I start to cry.</p>
<p>Carlos Alomar is spelling out your name with his guitar.</p>
<p>Carlos Alomar is spelling out our names with his guitar.</p>
<p>An overflow of joy in my eyes</p>
<p>for our twined &#147;I&#148;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CRITIQUE OF SEPARATION</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Some old poem</p>
<p>in me wanting</p>
<p>to be written</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>too many years</p>
<p>waiting for you</p>
<p>while not knowing</p>
<p>who I was waiting for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>missing piece</p>
<p>of a puzzle</p>
<p>fitting snugly</p>
<p>in the space</p>
<p>waiting for it</p>
<p>space empty</p>
<p>for so many years</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a sentence too</p>
<p>enormous to finish</p>
<p>as I try to understand</p>
<p>why I could</p>
<p>sustain myself with</p>
<p>lies and silence</p>
<p>with the unsaid</p>
<p>and the untouched</p>
<p>and what it is about</p>
<p>you that makes</p>
<p>that space of</p>
<p>separation no</p>
<p>longer necessary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some old poem</p>
<p>in me wanting</p>
<p>to be written,</p>
<p>a poem of</p>
<p>lyrical gestures</p>
<p>unselfconscious</p>
<p>brimming with magical thought</p>
<p>suitable for engraving</p>
<p>into the fine wood of a guitar</p>
<p>held in the hands</p>
<p>of the one I love</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POEM TO BE READ AT AN IMPEACHMENT</strong></p>
<br>
<p>No time for poetry</p>
<p>Time for more poetry</p>
<p>Nightmare election</p>
<p>Thugs and thieves given the keys</p>
<p>Nightmare election</p>
<p>Of myriad trumperies</p>
<p>Word that comes from Middle French</p>
<p><em>Tromper</em>, which means to deceive</p>
<p>As in <em>trompe l&#146;oeil</em></p>
<p>Fooling the eye</p>
<p>Thus <em>trompe le peuple</em></p>
<p>Fooling the people</p>
<p>Or at least an angry</p>
<p>Minority of them</p>
<p>No time for poetry</p>
<p>Time for more poetry</p>
<p>That says this will not stand</p>
<p>The rollback of every inch toward</p>
<p>Justice traveled</p>
<p>Since I was born</p>
<p>From Birmingham to Stonewall Inn</p>
<p>Nightmare election</p>
<p>What did we do wrong?</p>
<p>What did I do wrong?</p>
<p>What lessons of history</p>
<p>Did we misread</p>
<p>Underestimating</p>
<p>American greed?</p>
<p>How to explain</p>
<p>This debacle to</p>
<p>Daughters and sons?</p>
<p>Or make it right?</p>
<p>No time for poetry</p>
<p>Someone said,</p>
<p>Maybe me, maybe you</p>
<p>Mourning someone dead</p>
<p>In Charlottesville</p>
<p>After all, how many Nazis</p>
<p>Can a poem kill?</p>
<p>Time for poetry</p>
<p>Another said</p>
<p>Because the page is</p>
<p>The poet&#146;s field</p>
<p>Where he or she</p>
<p>Can take a knee.</p>
<p>Time for more poetry</p>
<p>If only to say</p>
<p>This will not stand</p>
<p>And won&#146;t be</p>
<p>Our legacy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
