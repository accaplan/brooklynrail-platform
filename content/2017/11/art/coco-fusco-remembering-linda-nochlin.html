<p>Like so many others, I am deeply indebted to Linda Nochlin's scholarship and feminist vision. I am also moved by her gracious support of younger scholars and artists. She was a brilliant and devoted mentor, and a profoundly committed and thoughtful art historian. I don't want to reduce her contributions to her field to one work because her range was broad, but that landmark essay, &ldquo;Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?&rdquo; completely revolutionized the field and transformed how we understand the construction of artistic genius. I have read that piece dozens of times and essentially learned how to debunk assumptions about art and artists thanks to Linda Nochlin. I am grateful to have known her and to have learned from her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best,</p>
