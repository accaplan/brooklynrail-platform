title: A Trip to the Alter with Priests

<p>Priests, the D.C.-based foursome consisting of vocalist Katie Alice Greer, guitarist G.L. Jaguar, drummer Daniele Daniele, and bassist Taylor Mulitz, defy easy categorization. The band&rsquo;s compelling, incendiary stagecraft was on full display at Basilica Hudson&rsquo;s SoundStage (with Merchandise&rsquo;s Carson Cox filling in for Taylor Mulitz on bass), a weekend of innovative and experimental music, visual art, and spoken word, plunked down in the county seat of Columbia County. Priests&mdash;whose debut album, <em>Nothing Feels Natural</em>, was released this year via the band&rsquo;s own Sister Polygon Records&mdash;is imbued with a loud, take-no-prisoners musical ethos, but it&rsquo;s an ethos that also references Portishead and Devo. The band, spawned from D.C.&rsquo;s incubator of activist music, offers an ideological critique that goes significantly deeper than a visceral response to the rise of the execrable Donald J. Trump, encompassing trenchant observations of systemic inequities that predate the current know-nothing White House occupant.</p>!!img1!!
<p>Priests&rsquo;s lyrical content, not surprisingly, is derived from a broad, literary context. &ldquo;Lelia 20&rdquo; pays homage to one of the protagonists of John Cassavetes&rsquo;s groundbreaking <em>Shadows</em> (1959). Lelia is a young African-American woman who cruelly falls victim to the era&rsquo;s unforgiving racial strictures: &ldquo;You are alone, I said / You are alone, I said / the space engulfs your head.&rdquo; The dysfunctional political landscape is aptly summarized in &ldquo;Pink White House&rdquo;: &ldquo;Magical psychology, deceptive anthropology / All the wing nuts got a haircut, bred and had babies / A puppet show in which you&rsquo;re made to feel you participate.&rdquo; And there is the haunting, elegiac &ldquo;Nothing Feels Natural&rdquo;: &ldquo;Perhaps I will change into something / swing wildly the other way / If I go without for days / will I finally hallucinate a real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priests&rsquo; exposure to right-wing lunacy is anything but anecdotal: Daniele Daniele and Taylor Mulitz both worked at Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria/concert venue that figured prominently in one of an ever-growing number of wing-nut conspiracy theories: Hillary Clinton, it was said, kept a ring of child sex slaves on Comet Ping Pong&rsquo;s very premises. Pizzagate, as it was dubbed, turned serious very quickly, as an armed avenger arrived on the scene and fired some shots.</p>
<p>While SoundStage was in full swing on this September weekend, the town of Hudson was host to another sort of performance in a nearby park, not more than a five-minute walk from Basilica Hudson: a full-fledged revival service, complete with scriptural exhortations and a call for &ldquo;our&rdquo; elected officials to profit from God&rsquo;s wise stewardship. Musing on the political situation both here and abroad, guitarist G.L. Jaguar opined that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just really a weird time to be alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a political dimension to almost anything you want to talk about,&rdquo; Katie Alice Greer says. &ldquo;Everything has a political implication. Whether you&rsquo;re making party rock or singing politically explicit songs . . . The irony is that someone who posits themselves or identifies as apolitical&rdquo; is, in fact, expressing &ldquo;the strongest political stance you can take, because you&rsquo;re holding up the status quo. You are obviously hiding behind privilege and the fact that you don&rsquo;t have to declare what you&rsquo;re thinking about. People who are marginalized are forced to wear their politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Daniele Daniele&mdash;who comes from a grad-school background of pop-culture studies via Marxism, feminism, and Jean Baudrillard&mdash;&ldquo;a lot of this discussion comes out of an environment where art has been commercialized; it&rsquo;s been monetized.&rdquo; She continues: &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re in a cynical era&rdquo;&mdash;and this is nothing if not a hyper-cynical era&mdash;there&rsquo;s an emergence of a &ldquo;meta, self-aware type of ideology to entrance consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A substantial portion of Priests&rsquo; musical advocacy is devoted to Sister Polygon. The creation of their own record label stemmed, in part, from what Jaguar describes as D.C.&rsquo;s intrinsic DIY musical ethic: &ldquo;We have this band, let&rsquo;s just record it! We&rsquo;ll put out an album&mdash;why not? That&rsquo;s how you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nice thing about doing it yourself,&rdquo; according to Greer, &ldquo;is not having to ask for permission,&rdquo; sometimes figuring it out along the way. &ldquo;Artists were willing to take a chance on us and us on them. We learned together as a community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Priests pay a price for their musical outreach. They are on the road for most of the year and are attempting to make themselves heard&mdash;literally and metaphorically&mdash;in an American society that does not, to put it mildly, exactly respect the artistic process. The band recently concluded a two-month European tour, playing most of their dates at government-subsidized venues, something that would be unthinkable here. But even where there <em>is</em> some sort of supportive nod toward art, there&rsquo;s most likely some lurking profit motive. To G.L. Jaguar, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really funny that a lot of major cities are like, &lsquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going to give artists grants; we&rsquo;re going to do this,&rsquo; but a lot of that&rsquo;s just trying to attract marketing and people to their city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Political developments in the U.S.&mdash;akin to a mash-up of Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> and Sinclair Lewis&rsquo;s <em>It Can&rsquo;</em><em>t Happen Here</em>&mdash;are fast outstripping any parody or dystopian rendering. But parody and satire, of course, can be funny. Dystopian fiction can be disregarded. What is <em>not</em> funny&mdash;nor can it be disregarded&mdash;is that there is a contingent of the population who truly believed that at Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s behest a sex slave ring was housed at a pizza parlor in the nation&rsquo;s capital. What is not funny is that a sizable number of Americans feel that we are a short step away from the full-fledged imposition of Sharia, or that the nation is being overrun by crazed, homicidal Mexicans. These are not fictive constructs.</p>
<p>In the face of all this seemingly insurmountable irrationality, how do Priests keep going? &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made music,&rdquo; Greer says, &ldquo;to build something that we&rsquo;ve wanted to be a part of . . . [at] a time like this, when things seem really bleak, it becomes more personally important than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The simple answer is: You just keep making music.&rdquo;</p>
