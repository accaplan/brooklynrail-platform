&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cold winds blowing 
  And life looks like some malignant disease, 
  Viewed from the heights of reason 
  Which I don&rsquo;t believe in,&rdquo; </p>

  1,<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall</em> </p>
  <p>
  <em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Coco (1990-2016)</em> </p>
  &nbsp; 
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Relinquishment,&rdquo; 
  at least that&rsquo;s what they say, When the haggling&rsquo;s done,  
  the act of opening the hand, 
  But if it ever truly ends, in between are phases 
  the experts will never recognize, 
  Interleaved w/ disbelief &amp; fury, insomnia, 
  delirium, glossolalia, 
  Or the stage in which one eats too much xanax, 
  gummy bears, &amp; caviar, &ldquo;takes a nap,&rdquo; 
  facedown, listening to the neighbor&rsquo;s old soul records 
  filtered through the floorboards,&nbsp; </p> 
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for me, 
  I keep attempting rational sentences despite myself, 
  Cold comfort,  
  an architecture of tics in rhetoric, Like,  
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good hoping for accuracy from the flowcharts  
  that mark grief&rsquo;s progression,&rdquo; 
  The map, &ldquo;after all,&rdquo; is not the swamp, 
  &amp; yet, &ldquo;one&rdquo; longs for &ldquo;an argument,&rdquo; &ldquo;nonetheless,&rdquo; 
  The &ldquo;In which&rdquo; in which the plot is laid bare, 
  As in &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; or other 
  &ldquo;arcane texts,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What comes next, </p>
<p>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savoring almost nothing 
  before grief resurges, what remains is the tension 
  of the chiastic structure 
  &amp; its spillage, As if it were an accident,  
  when delineating theodicy,  
  to lionize the Devil, How &ldquo;Elegiac,&rdquo; 
  rolled on the tongue 
  implies the beauty of others&rsquo; sorrows, 
  &ldquo;The Devil in the details,&rdquo; 
  or the accumulation of velleities 
  so many I know &amp; love  
  would ascribe to God&rsquo;s catastrophic hand, </p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you felt the opposite 
  when I described the taxonomy of mediocre poets 
  possessed by evil spirits, 
  How Jahiz believed the Devil guides the worst poets&rsquo; pens, 
  Angels, the best, 
  I never had the chance to ask you 
  what you thought the difference was,  
  Who but you would study Hegel&rsquo;s Science of Logic 
  as an elaborate joke, Appalled by angels 
  you didn&rsquo;t believe in, 
  like me, you still knew what it meant to be brushed 
  by the weight of their hem, 
  &amp; baffled, 
  A campy kind of aporea, Like, 
  &ldquo;Every angel is terrifying, well-built, 
  &amp; adorned in flame &amp; lam&eacute;,&rdquo;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strabismic w/ desire,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still longing to see what the future holds,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I employ reason 
  to make me feel what I know to be true,  
  when you&rsquo;re the one who animates my disbelief, lingering  
  like the day that&rsquo;s over  
  but clings to your nerves a while, &ldquo;Still wading  
  sentimentally in a year 
  That ended sentimentally in the middle of a season,&rdquo;  
  is how you put it, 
  Like lying still on a summer&rsquo;s evening 
  w/ the vestibular impress of 
  the pool&rsquo;s blue sway 
  rippling through your equilibrium, 
  An intaglio of motion, It washes over you, 
  &amp; you wake w/ a start,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift your face from the floorboards 
  to return to the freezer to freshen your drink,&nbsp;  
  &amp; you read,  
  as if by instinctual misprision, &ldquo;You surround me,&rdquo; 
  to be a kind of dysphoria, As in, 
  &ldquo;Who is this body 
  I&rsquo;m embedded in,&rdquo; it leaves you breathless, 
  &ldquo;Who are these people,&rdquo;  
  That old refrain, &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be life,&rdquo; 
  How it must feel to find your own words in quotes, 
  &ldquo;the body&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; That feeling 
  as if, if you&rsquo;re anything,  
  you&rsquo;re the flattening of so many 
  into one being, Possessed, 
  not relinquished, 
  their spell cast &amp; lingering in muscles&rsquo; memory, 
  as if drowning in, 
  or swaddled by them, A channel through which 
  grief returns refreshed, 
  the way the river traces the bed it carves, 
  on the surface unchanged, 
  yet deepened, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You surround me,&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>summer</em> </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this what true love feels like, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bitter Earth, 
  &amp; nonetheless yearning out of season 
  for saturnalian rites &amp; over- 
  saturation, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloodbath &amp; nonetheless the sky 
  &amp; dusky hydrangeas&rsquo; sopping blues 
  &amp; purples, terminally 
  in bloom, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Out from the pictures 
  of our bodies in the news, Before anybody dies 
  there&rsquo;s all this pleasure,&rdquo; 
  Then, the automatic knell irrupts the disco vesper 
  in this new dark age, 
  Like an open invitation to declare my love 
  for sentimentality, For, 
  as they say, &ldquo;Reason is,&rdquo; in a certain light, 
  &ldquo;The mere sentiment of those who can afford 
  to believe in a rational world,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what, I want to know, cuts w/o hesitation 
  to the quick, If you say, &ldquo;Say her name,&rdquo; 
  Say it again, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opal light, for instance, In liquid 
  crystal display light, The flimmer 
  of vaporizer 
  light or hotline bling 
  relucent 
  across the cab&rsquo;s back seat 
  idling in the hospital&rsquo;s 
  shadow, In the strobe of red 
  &amp; blue light- 
  emitting-diodes, In the night 
  club&rsquo;s magenta pulse, 
  In the idiorrhythmic light of the heart 
  rate monitor, Belying 
  delirium, </p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, 
  if only briefly, everything ceased being everything, 
  yet the record&rsquo;s dark arrondissement went on 
  spinning 
  anyway, even after the needle 
  had lifted,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, 
  no timestamp could make this hour 
  feel real, 3:22 of a Thursday, 
  arriving at the pearly gates via perverse 
  kinesis, Prince has died, 
  &amp; I remember when the playlist labeled &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; 
  was empty, </p>

4,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>winter</em> </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems slow at this distance 
  &amp; calmly fatal, A slight nova, Insignificant 
  diamonds &amp; rings of irrelevant 
  silk, Twin blue suns turning 
  a deeper blue, Torqued 
  &amp; twisting deeper as they slow, Each collapsing 
  into the vortex 
  of the other, Light swallowing light, &amp; briefly 
  an eclipse-green 
  autophagy, These future far-distant blackstars 
  like the fluorescent cells in the cervix, ovaries, etc. 
  highlighted by dyes 
  marking our mother&rsquo;s cancers&rsquo; 
  growth, Or the ultrasound grayscale twins 
  growing where their sister grew before them, 
  in my sister&rsquo;s 
  womb, </p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the photo-negative imaging 
  the tissues of their bodies look like heatwaves 
  flowing off of bright white masses, 
  What does it mean when all the colors are false, 
  The space-age purr 
  of the heavenly bodies, mere 
  artiface, 
  As the end advances, 
  do the seasons accelerate in their systems, Spring, 
  &amp; then spring again, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t simply re-apply the emulsion 
  crumbling from the tapes, 
  then listen, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen again, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, reading &ldquo;Dirty Poem,&rdquo; 
  it&rsquo;s clear, the body has enough to reckon w/ 
  within itself, &ldquo;Sugars 
  [foaming] in the pulp,&rdquo; The invisible apothecary, 
  &ldquo;brewing its own alcohols,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor&rsquo;s explanation is simple, if enigmatic, 
  The silver palomino, pent up &amp; anxious, 
  dances as if on stilettos, nipping at her flanks 
  till she bleeds, &ldquo;Hacking&rdquo; her nervous system,  
  she floods her enormous body 
  w/ wine,</p>

5, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>fall</em></p>
<p>
Q,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s the saddest music in the world,</p>
<p>
A,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s either me singing,  
  &ldquo;Sign &lsquo;O&rsquo; the Times&rdquo; cover to cover,  
  or all of the times 
  someone like you has wondered, &ldquo;But how much survives,  
  How much of any one of us  
  survives,&rdquo; Seemingly granting us all permission 
  to hate ourselves 
  less, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sugar 
  in your eyes, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunk on blood,  
  Everything slowly turning  
  a misty blue, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring, &ldquo;Goodbye,  
  cruel world,&rdquo; then leaving behind a vault  
  of silently blistering  
  solos, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sketch for a love song written in imperial time, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo;  
  &amp; a selfie in a 16th C, vanity,  
  Or a saint&rsquo;s flayed  
  skin, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charmingly, 
  mosquitoes sting my knuckles 
  as I write this,  
  emulating summer, I guess, 22&deg;  
  centigrade, early in the evening in early  
  November, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go down, sip Arak on the stoop,&nbsp;  
  A splash of cold water,  
  An instant pearl,  
  Warm enough out to read  
  &ldquo;Neon Clouds&rdquo; in a cheap silk shirt,&nbsp;  
  starry-night- 
  like, &amp; overlaid w/ pinwheels,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Everything changes, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy settings, the century,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or,  
  how did the president put it  
  in her now infamous State of the Union Address,  
  &ldquo;When I look away 
  the next century will come, then 
  another one,&rdquo;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, leaving Tibor de Nagy  
  I wandered East on a night like this &amp; puked vertiginously 
  at 56th &amp; Park, Something rattles  
  in my skull, a lily- 
  of-the-valley in my jaw, Little more than floralegia  
  &amp; a deathdrive, The lines  
  from infinite jets  
  scudding off across a starless, ailing ozone,  
  Remembering Lisa Robertson  
  saying something like, &ldquo;Psychology oozes  
  from every object,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thinking of the color  
  &ldquo;old money,&rdquo; I want to know,  
  Who of you will invent  
  a new metric  
  that cuts, most quickly, 
  to the truth, Visions of &ldquo;everyday justice  
  spoken in everyday 
  speech,&rdquo; 
  That which can be measured in erratic tonnage, 
  in moraines exposed ,  
  &amp;c, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Goodbye,  
  green world,&rdquo; as another green world enters  
  &amp; exits our orbit, At 180  
  grams, it decays as it spins so we only ever listen  
  on the equinox,  
  which seems just to have passed  
  but is, no doubt,  
  quickly approaching,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloom
  of mould on a spear of wheat

  on warmish spring days  
  dripping dew 
  down onto kudzu, Black acorns  
  the wind&rsquo;s combed out,  
  rotting,&nbsp; A nasty soil to grow anything in,  
  but there&rsquo;s plenty of acid  
  &amp; the hydrangeas are a creamy sapphire  
  in that corner,  
  a basic purple where there&rsquo;s none, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corymbs drifting in the air lack fixity,  
  But when I follow the glowing path  
  of the searchlight over the city, I know where it goes  
  when it roves in the East, 
  Still, I try to feel only for whatever&rsquo;s outside my window,  
  or trapped between the glass,  
  Glacial nosegay, Bluebottle husks  
  &amp; cigarette butts, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warped circle

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I believe the purpose of death is the release of love,&rdquo;
  Laurie Anderson wrote when Lou Reed died,  
  &amp; we filled thermoses w/ sangria,  
  got wasted in the park,  
  Spent the day flipping &ldquo;Berlin&rdquo; A to B B to A,  
  Clicked repeat &amp; looped  
  &ldquo;Sunday Morning&rdquo; all afternoon, repeat, 
  &amp; cried in public, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sound you hear 
  in your head, It&rsquo;s your nerves  
  or your blood running,&rdquo;  
  Reed said in his last interview,  
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of amazing to hear that,  
  You&rsquo;re in a hospital, you have an ultrasound  
  &amp; they turn it up,  
  you hear your blood flowing,  
  It sounds like a Moog,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawstrings of his scrubs drawn tight, 
  It&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s dying, He claims he sleeps w/ his guitar,  
  never practiced, never was taught,  
  but &ldquo;played from the heart,&rdquo;  
  As if that&rsquo;s all it was,  
  Blood-noise feeding back to blood,  
  His living fugue too quiet to hear, &ldquo;My life  
  is music,&rdquo; he says as the shot fades,  
  As if, amplifying his body&rsquo;s last days&rsquo; drone 
  through the feedback,  
  the closed-circuit&rsquo;s vital infinity, might preserve him,  
  turn him revenant  
  under the needle, As if you could destroy the instrument  
  but keep the song,

10, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>summer </em></p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awake before I mean to be,  
  feeling religious when I don&rsquo;t want to be,  
  surveying the xeroxed poems,  
  the books I have  
  but haven&rsquo;t read, scraps  
  of handwritten &ldquo;Mornings&rdquo; cut out  
  to stuff my pockets w/,  
  memorize, &amp; toss out, Notebooks 
  w/ Xs struck through lengthy strophes  
  on tics &amp; nervy  
  twitching, as if I could redact the surge  
  of yen, compose an ode, 
  instead,  
  to the &ldquo;pathetic fallacy&rdquo; which defines  
  my life, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bluster of irrational  
  winds, The bludgeoning  
  brutish light  
  of summer, To winters lived for magenta,  
  twilit eyelids,  
  &amp; keyhole tans when you blink,&nbsp; To spring,  
  &amp; the promise of lines  
  as endless &amp; recursive as scenes on toile,  
  sublingual, yanked 
  in a smooth stream from the throat,  
  As if spooled 
  where the heart belongs,  
  Bright bolts 
  inscribed w/ cupid shrines,  
  Scenes on bedclothes  
  of couples, mutely reclined,  
  or in medias res,  
  in bustles of electrical woad, dancing  
  a grand galop around fountainheads w/ arcs  
  of never-falling water, Ruffling  
  the air, Waiting, 
  yes, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A helical furl,</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How parlando dissipates  
  as soon as it leaves  
  your lips, Slows  
  time,  
  but cannot reverse it, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chinoiserie,  
  a funerary shroud  
  w/ arabesques,  
  you can bury me in, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another season wants to come  
  &amp; change the contents of my blood again, 
  I can feel it,  
  like the dark oak outside my window, 
  its inner-creaking &amp; the leaves that hush it,  
  When light fills it, it moves the way a river does,  
  mimicking itself, Dark leaves  
  &amp; leaf-cut light, New,  
  yet somehow always the same,  
  They keep telling me,  
  &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re young, it&rsquo;s like this, Resistless,  
  your mouth opens,  
  music exits, But you&rsquo;ll learn, in time,  
  to forget such feelings,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Song  
  is one kind of breath,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;A note  
  for nothing, 
  god&rsquo;s silence when it ceases,&rdquo; </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a better way to put it, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No,  
  the body's body's air&rsquo;s ore&rsquo;s  
  not a luxury, </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it rusted, </p>
