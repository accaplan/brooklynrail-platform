title: WIDE STEPS UP (FOR JOHN GIORNO)
---

<blockquote><p>Shifting scale of persons to surroundings
The white rocks shrink and grow
Gravely in the night

This earth cannot live without holy rites. 

Lots of hills to climb up and down.
A straight ravine between the friars.

Turn to the right
And you will fall to the left.

One pilgrim wears a beard
Down to his chest

But love hates coverings.
And prefers to be seen and, if despised,
To melt away quickly.

No gloss is allowed
To weaken the bliss of scripture.</p></blockquote>
