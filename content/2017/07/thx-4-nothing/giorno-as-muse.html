title: GIORNO AS MUSE
---

<p>Not long ago I saw a terrific film made by the abstract painter Jos&eacute; Parl&aacute;, who has been commissioned to create a large mural for One World Trade Center and decided to create the documentary <em>ONE: Union of the Senses</em> about the process of making the painting and the city that inspired it. In an on-stage interview after the film, which premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to the accompaniment of a live jazz orchestra, Parl&aacute; said he envisioned it as a love letter to New York: its rhythms, its subway, its streetscapes, its thrillingly diverse population. I don&rsquo;t remember the word &ldquo;muse&rdquo; being used during the talk, but it certainly ran through my mind, and doubtless it occurred to others in the audience. The film was Parl&aacute;&rsquo;s buoyant and grateful thank you to the city that had inspired him.</p>!!img1!!	
<p>In 2002 I published a book entitled <em>The Lives of the Muses</em>. To be honest, the relationship between the muse and the artist served for me more as a principle of selection than a subject of inquiry. I used an admittedly binary, limited, and limiting template (male artist, female muse) to choose and contrast certain narratives&mdash;from literary and art history&mdash;that I wanted to tell about the relationship between men and women. It wanted to keep things simple, to keep the parameters narrow.</p>
<p>But then, as now, I actually believe that a muse&mdash;if we are using the word not to mean one of the Greek goddesses but more loosely to signify the source and wellspring of inspiration&mdash;can be anyone, of any gender, any race, any age. It can be a lover or partner, an artist&rsquo;s model (as it clearly was for so many painters of the past), a family, a child, a face we glimpse on the street. It can be a landscape, a town, a newspaper clipping, or (as it often was for Henry James) an anecdote we hear at a dinner party. It can even be another work of art: the urge to write something as good as Kafka&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Judgment.&rdquo;</p>!!img2!!	
<p>A muse can be whomever or whatever makes an artist want to go to the studio, the desk, the piano, the rehearsal stage&mdash;and work.</p>
<p>In <strong><em>I </em></strong><strong><em><span style="font-family: NimbusSanRegIta;">&hearts;</span> John Giorno</em></strong>, Ugo Rondinone pays tribute to the poet, visual and sound artist John Giorno as his muse. Giorno and Rondinone have been lovers for eighteen years. Curated by Rondinone, the show&mdash;which includes Giorno&rsquo;s extensive archive and documents the range of his work&mdash;not only celebrates the career of an important artist but tells the sort of story we all want to hear: almost twenty years&mdash;and Rondinone still thinks of the guy as his muse! To acknowledge someone as your muse is the greatest expression of gratitude, of love, and respect. The xhibition includes Rondinone&rsquo;s film, <em>Thanx 4 Nothing</em>, in which Giorno recites a poem by that name, yet we can assume that the show&rsquo;s title might just as well have been <em>Thanx 4 Everything</em>.</p>
