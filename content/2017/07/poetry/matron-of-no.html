title: Matron of No

<p>There are so many paintings of Lucretia <br>   stabbing herself and they&rsquo;re all <br>   pretty terrific. My personal favorites <br>   are the ones where she looks bored (Rembrandt,<br>   Parmigianino, Sellaer, Cranach <br>   the Elder) like she&rsquo;s just sticking <br>   a casual reminder <br>   between her tits that life is suffering, <br>   and a certain quota of daily blood <br>   is needed for a decant into that ancient <br>   ceremonial chalice of feminine shame. Drip </p> <p>drip. Reclining on a sofa in the mid-century style <br>   I allow a stranger&rsquo;s black and white boy cat <br>   with bright pink rubber caps on all its claws <br>   and a clipped tail to knead a soft space, this shelf <br>   of fat above my organs. It feels invasive <br>   but not unpleasant, a therapy <br>   taken in foggy discomfort.</p> <p>Caught in my phone&rsquo;s own beam<br>   is my greasy face, which, downturned, <br>   admires the Expressionist skyscraper<br>   proposed but never built<br>   by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe <br>   for Berlin&rsquo;s Friedrichstra&szlig;e, its points <br>   pointing at an overgrowth in me,<br>   my finger hovering over the street,<br>   no vehicles below, no people,<br>   the black smudge of city movement<br>   implying by erasure<br>   those who move through <br>   its striated, dynamic soot. </p> <p>And what of the top? A blade garden.<br>   Full of women seeking aesthetic revenge.<br>   I think I might like to go away.<br>   I think I might like to bond <br>   with the darkest stuff, revisit the peeling corner <br>   that exists in almost every room,<br>   and is exquisite artwork that nobody looks at&#151;<br>   to sit with it awhile until a feeling of lateral<br>   motion takes over, a whisk <br>   into a syncretion of senses <br>   from different legendary themes.</p> <p>And now the cat is on the dining room table<br>   licking goat cheese from an earthenware bowl. <br>   The big windows let the night in on a timer.<br>   The room does its thing to me again. <br>   &ldquo;Your lips / your eyes.&rdquo; That gentle shuffle <br>   of petals across the brain.&#8195;</p>
