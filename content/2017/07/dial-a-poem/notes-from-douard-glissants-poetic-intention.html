title: NOTES FROM &Eacute;DOUARD GLISSANT'S POETIC INTENTION
---

<p>No dependency in relation to nature; art chooses and purifies: in that resides liberty and the power of the mind.</p>!!img1!!	
<p>For if, within the information sublimated (relegated) by a language, one approached yesterday and formerly different languages, and perhaps seriated them, we should take into account that tomorrow&rsquo;s being will naturally speak several languages; that each language (each choice of parlance) will run from one of these languages to others, of course by its motivations and not within a mechanism of vocabulary (otherwise language will have been reduced to an Esperanto); that consequently that analysis of each language should integrate the study not only of concerned languages but again of their conjugated reaction in the being. To define a language will be to define the general attitude of the being before the words he is using, yes; but also to approach the principle (in the being) of an elocutionary symbiosis which will signify one of the modalities of its liaison to the totality of the world.</p>!!img2!!	
<p>Language will then no longer be, in the expression of being, pure obstacle and pure accomplishment; it will include as well, always in contradiction, detention and relation. Poetic language will not only be approached differently than common parlance, but already as the language of a language&hellip; It is moreover not a matter either of submitting to nature or of profiting from it, but, through the poem, of granting it a sort of nurturing catalysis: in this will (or that deaf desire) to redo, through the poem, the Moderns are noticeably different from the <em>Naturalists </em>of the old poetics. Finally, this last ambition posits the poem as a thing which, created, also responds densely to the laws of existence and of duration.&hellip; Neither a realist nor a mystic, since here it is possible to be a visionary without being a mystic&hellip; an undertaker of the concrete. But how does one carry out this art that is &ldquo;an eminently terrestrial thing&rdquo;. One cannot help but stumble against the obstacle, the torment without end, which is also its only weapon: the word. <br /> 
<p>A landscape. What is that, to man?</p>
<p>For him, no &ldquo;concept of the world,&rdquo; no body of doctrine, no tyrannical system implicating its environs. Is this to abdicate the so-called powers of poetry, to wean poetry from its ambition to illuminate? Is it to return it&mdash;naively and falsely crude&mdash;to a state of pure poetry? Is it to mummify it with sentiment and confession?</p>
<p>Because he granted (in verse) metric inspiration to human respiration, because he fills the poem with the massive shadow of the real.&hellip; In his vow, his option, in the abruptness of his poetics, by the dry justness of his parlance, he dominates. The ambiguity of this verb is appropriate to his nature.</p>
<p>When then is language? This cry that I elected? Not only the cry, but absence beating in the cry?</p>
<p>Language of &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; true force.</p>
<p>He claims it, provokes it if necessary. &ldquo;I will inhabit my name.&rdquo;</p>
