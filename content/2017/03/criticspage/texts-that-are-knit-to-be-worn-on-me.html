<p>The body is another venue for showing work. Wearing a stretched canvas can be difficult when driving or on the subway, but if the form of the work is something that customarily fits a human being, it makes things more straightforward. My sweaters are examples of self-publishing. They are texts that are knit to be worn on me, to circulate along with my body in the world, like a traditional printed publication. </p>
