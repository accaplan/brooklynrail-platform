<p>Downtempo skating, unhurried kissing, slow dancing <br />With broken rhythm like <em>Surfing on Finnegans Wake</em>.<br />Incremental footsteps breeding images that perch<br />So proudly on the horizons like <em>imaging delphi.</em><br />Centralized, massive countenances that won&rsquo;t stand still.</p>
<p>Firmly etched epitaph, pictograph, image-signs on <br />These fields of vision. Yo-he-yo, ta-ta Coptic <br />Ashkenazi cuneiforms. Vow, owl, nose, old, smile, <br />Eye, kind friends of urban pantheism who have seen<br />From close-up this singular evolution.</p>
<p>Texts in semi-bold lines spreading across the capacity.<br />Leaping above the static screens only one-eighth of <br />An inch. I said that&rsquo;s what you think!<br />Me and you, <em>Boxcar Bertha</em>, Ginger Rogers let loose<br />Kangaroo, boomerang, hooded figures, mountaintops, </p>
<p>Hemlock trees, magic mountains; they are long-ago <br />Megaliths, terrestrial lung/gill-breathing creatures <br />At indescribable sites that I&rsquo;ve seen in my past life. <br /><em>Crown mountain tunnel </em>floats in blue locality. <br /><em>Red crown mountain, CMT 2 </em>prefer to rest on </p>
<p>Solid pedestals. They, too, are the subjects of <br />Extraordinary skin. Inside, outside, left and right,<br /><em>Bell Jar</em> computations, Pac-Man doodles, <br />Asteroid arcades, she can&rsquo;t wait to gather her myrrh, <br />Colocynth, nutmeg, mastic, etc. to offer </p>
<p>Who appreciates Paracelsus, Jungian archetypes,<br />Ancient ideograms, rapping Gustonian gestations, <br />Cook-a-doodle-doo, <em>moonflower three</em>, etc.? <br />A testament of endurance.<br />Keep smiling! It&rsquo;s a love poem of <em>the original me + you</em>.</p>
