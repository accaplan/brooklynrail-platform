<p>When Tim Rollins became a trustee of the Bronx Museum in 2009 I was elated. I had followed his work with K.O.S. with great interest since I moved to New York in 1988, and recall meeting him briefly during a reception at the Fabric Workshop around that time. I always admired his mixing art and education, his love for John Dewey and Paulo Freire, but when we finally had a chance to work together, as he became the chair of our Education Committee, I discovered yet another facet to the man: an unwavering commitment to the working class, and to sharing his gift with anyone who cared to listen. Tim was a larger than life figure, and his stature will only grow as we look back at all the he accomplished with K.O.S..&nbsp;</p>
