title: 'Dear Friends and Readers,'

<p>I remember growing up in a divided house. A discontented citizen,<br>
Confused, self-shuffling member of an old family grown new. 
You and I separated by an invisible wall of an unbroken ideology 
That existed long before the mind learned how to dictate the body.</p> 

<p>I remember growing up in a divided house. My grandfather was<br>
A resolute communist. My grandmother was indifferent to 
The people&rsquo;s National Liberation Front. 
They rarely looked at each other&rsquo;s eyes at the dinner table.</p> 

<p>I remember the burning sun at dawn on New Year&rsquo;s Day of 1968.<br> 
How the light was quickly dimmed by the immense flocks of 
Helicopters like swarms of mosquitoes hungry for blood 
After a long monsoon season in the low land.</p>
 
<p>I remember it was more awe-inspiring than the opening scene<br> 
Of <em>Apocalypse Now</em> with <em>The End</em> by the Doors in the 
Background; more memorable than Operation Linebacker I and II; 
More picturesque than Operation Rolling Thunder, and whatnot.</p>
 
<p>I remember it was even more exalted than Operation Chopper<br> 
Before I was born. They were indeed the mothers of 
Operation Desert Storm and the bombing of Iraq in 1991. 
Whatever operation that keeps me here and you there. 
Vietnamization is just a catchy phrase while 
Tricky Dick is relishing his Ch&acirc;teau Lafite Rothschild one afternoon.</p>
 
<p>I remember the screams of the wounded being drowned out <br>
By the screams of the bereaved. They were everywhere on 
The streets leading to the Pagoda of the Celestial Lady.</p> 


<p>I remember on the temple&rsquo;s wall how serene<br>
Buddha was sitting in profile under the Bodhi tree in the shelter 
Of the natural world.</p>
 
<p>I remember chanting with my grandmother,<br> 
&ldquo;Let my skin and sinews and bones dry up, 
Together with all flesh and blood of my body. 
But I will not move from this spot until I have 
Attained the supreme and final wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
 
<p>I remember the lord of desire Mara presiding over the enormous<br> 
Elephant with many sharp tusks, sending his most 
Beautiful daughters to seduce Siddhartha&mdash; 
They failed for he remained in deep meditation. </p>

<p>I remember on another wall a vast army of monsters in<br> 
The forms of piercing arrows aiming at the Buddha&rsquo;s front torso. 
They, too, failed for he remained in deep meditation 
As they turned into adoring bouquets of flowers 
On the ground behind his back. </p>

<p>I remember Malcolm Browne&rsquo;s black and white photograph <br>
Of Th&iacute;ch Qu&#7843;ng &#272;&#7913;c&rsquo;s self-immolation in the busy street of 
Saigon long before it was called Ho Chi Minh City. 
The flames burst forth to consume his body 
But he had gone long before the spectacle. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when I was told there were two kinds of<br>
Human beings: those who aspire to move forward 
And those who insist on walking backwards. 
Who else cares enough to look at the bright sun and the shining moon? </p>

<p>I was taught to remember to keep my precepts with the purest<br>
Of hearts and be humble in the divided house. 
North and South, left and right, here and there, 
Now and then, I will always be forever caught in 
The space in between with my finger touching 
The earth. Nirvana is nowhere else than here. Amen!</p>
