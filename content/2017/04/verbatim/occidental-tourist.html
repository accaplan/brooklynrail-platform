<p>In Paul Bowles&rsquo;s acclaimed 1949 novel <em>The Sheltering Sky</em>, the primary characters, Port and Kit Moresby, journey through Saharan Africa as if navigating a dissociative dreamscape: the familiar is slightly askew; contemporary and ancient become indistinguishable; Occidental logic slowly slips into hallucinatory detachment. </p>

<p>In 1947 the New York City-born Bowles had taken up residence in Tangier, a city whose exotic allure similarly captivated Francis Bacon, Tennessee Williams, and William S. Burroughs. A polymath composer, writer, and expert translator, Bowles consumed the cultural and psychic landscape of Morocco, delving deep into the country&rsquo;s hidden recesses. Methodically, he made audio recordings of native tales preserved through the oral tradition, translating them into English from Maghrebi.</p>

<p>Bowles first encountered Ahmed ben Driss el Yacoubi in Fez in 1947. The young Moroccan, born in 1928, was descended from a family that practiced the healing profession of <em>f&rsquo;qih. </em>Although forbidden by religion from depicting idols, Yacoubi secretly drew figurative images in ink and, in 1948, was introduced to paint by Jane Bowles, Paul&rsquo;s wife. Yacoubi&rsquo;s ensuing canvases were colorful, densely abstract compositions packed with energy; heavily layered surfaces were smoothed through a process that Yacoubi likened to alchemical transformation. </p>

<p>With the young Yacoubi under his wing, Paul Bowles wrote to Betty Parsons in 1951 to advocate for &ldquo;a young Arab painter from Fez, a natural abstractionist, as is to be expected when there has been no tradition in the culture save that of absolute abstraction.&rdquo; The following year the Betty Parsons Gallery staged an exhibition of Yacoubi&rsquo;s work, and soon after he made the acquaintance of Peggy Guggenheim, who purchased several of his paintings. Concurrently, Paul Bowles translated several of Yacoubi&rsquo;s stories into English, including the play <em>The Night Before Thinking</em>, which was eventually published in the <em>Evergreen Review</em> in 1961. </p>

<p>In 1966, Yacoubi departed his native Morocco for New York City, where he painted in a downtown loft. Yacoubi was illiterate; his frequent and enduring correspondence with Bowles was read and transcribed by friends, including a 1979 letter in which Bowles cautiously offers an introduction to Yacoubi&rsquo;s painting from the perspective of a writer, rather than art critic. </p>

<p>Like Bowles, who had largely escaped his roots to become a permanent expatriate in Tangier, Yacoubi embraced the United States as an artistic catalyst and place of exotic fascination, dying in New York City in 1985 at the age of fifty-seven. Bowles lived until 1999 as both a tremendous presence in the literary landscape and an elusive voice embedded within the ancient rhythms of the human condition. </p>
