<p style="font-size: 14pt;">That Kind of Poem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It's lovely no more radiation treatments though ev-
  eryone prefers being alarmed about politics
  to poetry and that's a mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's a crisis of
  course. I'm so happy not to go to l'Institut Curie
  at least for months I dreamed of an empty body
  last night a decision as to what necklace should be</p>
<p>
put inside it. Last June you knew all this was
  coming yes and every day writing poetry creating
  the real Real World. I answered the phone to
  a telemarketer on Thursday and a voice says in French
  'I'm calling on behalf of Monsieur Lorenzo the Medium'
  I hung up laughing and thought of Lorenzo Thomas</p>
<p>
after he died 2005 I dreamed he burst out of his coffin
  in Chicago the Diversey St house where we first bonded '72
  he was wearing a shower cap but seemed to be
  exhorting me to . . . what? and dust there was
  dust on him it was a long time of agos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vietnam
  my brother's just back I said to him</p>
<p>
who would have thought the poem says I'd be
  still alive and in Paris, France for the health care
  this dusty form is my beauty crystal neck-
  lace you're smashing Lorenzo great poet who
  we were I can't figure what lasts on a tiny
  planet of phantasmagoria except one's love</p>

You may have become too detached
  knowing how to do things though
  you can't stop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like literacy
  those other shoes I haven't worn much
  high&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why in that production of
  <em>Agamemnon</em> did Cassandra wear
  platforms? and something about spit
  No reason to accept the story you're</p>
<p>
given, right? I went to the play in 2011
  The chorus was the same face projected
  on a screen numerous times with vocal overlap
  I have I have never and I refuse have been to
  be in a chorus I cannot be the chorus the com-
  munity I reject the concept though
  there you are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prose is when you
  say what's approved or condemned</p>
<p>
I mean poetry that's really prose and in the
  chorus you approve of prose though you
  speak poetry unknowingly all your life
  At that time I but what? As in
  theater the lines invade the actors
  you in life cannot resist your lines
  Bad poets talk about guilt and you nod
  but guilt is inarticulateable so the real poet</p>
<p>
leaves it out and expresses my anguish at being
  in a theater alone speaking French to some-
  one who turned out to be English dressed up in
  black I remember how to be Cassandra I
  remember disliking the mirror-image politics
  of disagreement allowing cruelty pretense of
  being wronged and you do get it? I don't ever
  and don't hit back or click tongue callously</p>
<p>
given? was it given can you stop what-
  ever no I re-enter my apartment do you
  and do you win remember the hoax you have ap-
  proved I don't approve of anything what
  I saw coming was only masses of wrong-
  headed traffic air-killing foolish hurrying
  home everyone hurrying home from it inside
  is nothing changing inside where you are . . . No?</p>
<p>
have you changed yourself inside Yes I have
  working on it in the most incomprehensible
  way the chorus wouldn't what about the spit out of
  which spit was created&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I find I'm
  no common humanity good out of focus
  the building is old and the play is older by
  Seneca whose life moral question she walks
  and I walk out of that theater having no more lines</p>
<p>
no more chorus the community is a hoax then?</p>
