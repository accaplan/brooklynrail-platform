THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS</p><br/>
<p>
Sickness 
  is a kind of clarity</p>
<p>
It makes you feel afraid
  and love to be alive</p>
<p>
It interests me 
  to be afraid </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My claim is 
  on the absolute</p>
<p>
I never wanted to be free 
  only to be nothing</p>
<p>
And to love 
  to be alive </p>
<p>
Just like the French 
  my beauty&rsquo;s nourished 
  by its own 
  disgrace, I love
  when it&rsquo;s disgusting </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Jealously
  I wash myself </p>
<p>
The sacrament of being 
  held without affection </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My only purity
  is in my failure
  to be satisfied </p>
<p>
My long, long nails</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We will never comprehend this
  nor what hinders you </p>
<p>
The horror, I confess</p>
<p>
I cannot have you
  without being 
  and you know what I&rsquo;d prefer </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

KENNETH ANGER </p><br/>
<p>
This film is a ritualistic study 
  on transfiguring of space 
  I announce 
  as my arms and legs turn perfectly symmetrical </p>
<p>
END </p>
<p>
I point to the way forward 
  with my foot </p>
<p>
It is a long way </p>
<p>
Women raise their heads to look 
  as the clarinet sounds
  Another woman 
  squeegeeing the shower door </p>
<p>
I climb in the shower stall 
  and wait </p>
<p>
There is no space to lie 
  Saint Michael said 
  You cannot see me in the flames 
  so I wrote what I wanted on a bottle 
  and I threw it in the street </p>
<p>
Branches slide across my neck</p>
<p>
Rolling down the window 
  two boys looking wavy at me
  blow up in surprise </p>
<p>
it&rsquo;s days like these 
  I fathom the pathology 
  of failure over time </p>
<p>
I say 
  You look like a courtroom drawing </p>
<p>
I say 
  Picture Kenneth at the dentist 
  Dad&rsquo;s collapsing face 
  and dreams of shooting 
  eagles from the sky </p>
<p>
Dogs, when pissing 
  zone out
  humming</p>
<p>
Honda Honda Honda Homda Om </p>

<p style="font-size: 12.5pt;">
TO THE DEATH OF FORESTS </p><br/>
<p>
Trees are insufferable 
  Their giant leaves
  Sad
  Showy </p>
<p>
Their&nbsp;relentless introspection 
  and their clarity </p>
<p>
They know&nbsp;how to stand there</p>
<p>
In the absence of anything splendid</p>
<p>
In the limited season 
  of my voice</p>
<p>
Devoted 
  to an antiquated predicament</p>
<p>
Trees rise</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size: 12.5pt;white-space:nowrap;">
YOU DID NOT ASSIMILATE, WHICH IS THE PRIVILEGE OF A KING
  or
  I REGRET HAVING TO ABANDON YOU BUT I MAY NEVER ABANDON MYSELF
  or
  IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION?</p><br/>

<p>
Your objections 
  are less passionate 
  than&nbsp;my&nbsp;desires</p>
<p>
All my drives
  are baseless
  and therefore 
  indisputable</p>
