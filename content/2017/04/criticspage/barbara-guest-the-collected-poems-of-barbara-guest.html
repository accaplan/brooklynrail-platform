<p>This volume, a 600-page-long feast, beautifully showcases why Barbara Guest (1920 &#150; 2006) remains a Guest, singularly and generously&#151;her <em>geist</em> still edging up to and through you, like, right <em>now</em>. A micro-cinepoetic border-crosser, Guest epochalized here is already well-known for her exquisite, exacting ways of connecting and weaving her way through various modernist and postmodern Avant-garde trends, visual and verbal, including objectivist poetry, Abstract Expressionism, language poetry, etc.; and yet reviewing her oeuvre today, this life-long work of incandescent mobile nexus, one would, as I do, feel struck also by a certain conceptual intimacy as well as compositional intricacy of the timbre of her, say, <em>alto</em>-lyrical voice that is almost post-Internet for its psycho-topological capacity to hold open tight such a space of liminal-vectorial alterity (<em>al-to</em>) that could also sound &ldquo;all-too&rdquo; lyrical at least to some ears, as we hear her saying: </p>
<p style="font-size:10pt;margin-left:20px">I am closer to you<br>
Than land and I am in a stranger ocean<br>Than I wished</p>
<p>in &ldquo;Parachutes, My Love, Could Carry Us Higher.&rdquo;
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; the metonym for one another or-and the other freed up there, &ldquo;<em>alyric</em>&rdquo; in Charles Bernstein&rsquo;s coding, become(s) the inter-subject that literalizes the liquid margins, the plasticity of &ldquo;lyric negation&rdquo; as Robert Kaufman says about Guest&rsquo;s &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; of Adorno&rsquo;s critical aesthetics, in which I also hear <em>in</em>actment&#151;a possibility of. In the age of lyrical crisis or critical lyricism, this infra-poetics of intersubjective alterity, its poethical sensibility, remains an inspirational mortar, a motor for differential self-en<em>gendering</em>. Guest, of the New York School, will edge you in, so to speak, without closing you in or on you; the hosting guest follows and takes us somewhere higher through the border, lighter even, as she brushes a breath into time, again <em>now</em>, with that stroke of gentle genius. If Frank O&rsquo;Hara, in comparison, engages the second-person directly, and John Ashbery, more neutro-gesturally through the collective impersonalization of the first, Guest, attuned to both of you, keeps you somewhere between, like a 0.5/1.5/2.5(th) person, as she, each of her pieces, becomes the &ldquo;shuffling mind&rdquo; with a mini-propeller, an ear, for a soft ensouled flight <em>somelsewhere</em>&nbsp;you didn&rsquo;t know you could see, as &ldquo;the Sky Sinks Slowly Inside the Past&rdquo;: Of You, My Guest. </p>
