<p>Daniil Kharms, a key figure of second-wave Russian radical modernism, extends, distorts, and renews the achievements of La Fontaine, the Brothers Grimm, Poe, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Chekov, Lewis Carrol, Sholem Aleichem, Kafka, Shklovsky, and Khlebnikov. Kharms&rsquo;s obliquely allegorical dark comedies are at once mystical and mythic, Daoist and Dadaist, daring and deranging, surrealist and satiric, metaphysical and metafictional. Kharms first became known to English-speaking readers in <em>OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism</em>, ed. Eugene Ostashevsky (also Northwestern, 2006). Three key OBERIU translations followed: Matvei Yankelevich&rsquo;s <em>Today I Wrote Nothing: The Selected Writings of Daniil Kharms</em> (Overlook, 2009), Ostashevsky&rsquo;s <em>Alexander Vvedensky: An Invitation for Me to Think</em> (NYRB/Poets, 2013), which is the first English-language collection of the great other main OBERIU writer, and Anthony Anemone and Peter Scotto&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;I am a Phenomenon Quite Out of the Ordinary&rdquo;:</em> <em>The Notebooks, Diaries and Letters of Daniil Kharms </em>(Academic Studies Press, 2013). Alex Cigale&rsquo;s sparkling translations are a welcome complement to these books. In Khams&rsquo;s metamorphoses, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;and then&rdquo;: the works hover between theater of the absurd, surrealism, and magic realism while maintaining their ever-uncanny grounding in the ordinary. Charting the experience of everyday life in Russia in the 1920s and &rsquo;30s, Kharms can perhaps be described best as an (anti-)Soviet realist. His fantastical parables refuse the syllogistic order of brutal causality. He may seem loony, and maybe he was; but in a world gone mad, Kharms is, ironically, a last refuge of sanity. </p>
