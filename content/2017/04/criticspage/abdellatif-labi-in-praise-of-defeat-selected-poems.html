<p>Abdellatif La&acirc;bi is without a doubt the major francophone voice in Moroccan poetry today. He writes with a quiet, unassuming elegance that holds &amp; hides the violence any act of creation proposes. Every creation is of course a breaking apart, a making of fragments, something La&acirc;bi states <em>ab initio</em>in his poem&ldquo;Forgotten Creation&rdquo;: &ldquo;In the beginning was the cry / and already discord.&rdquo; Creating itself, the poem learns that &ldquo;where nothing is born / nothing changes,&rdquo; and that eternity is but &ldquo;an impenetrable jar / no magic will open.&rdquo; But the poem, La&acirc;bi insists, will get us inside this act of imaginative creation. It is exactly the processual nature of his poetics, demanding a close listening to both inside and outside worlds, and the will and courage to follow changing meanders as the outside historical situation and the personal ecology of the poet&rsquo;s world evolve, at times clash, but always inform&#151;taking careful account of both the &ldquo;in&rdquo; and the &ldquo;form&rdquo; the word proposes&#151;his work. La&acirc;bi has been clear that his essential battle has been the one he fights against the hiatus between discourse and praxis, between thought and action, between the work&#151;including that of <em>poesis</em>, of poetry&#151;and the man: &ldquo;For me ethics is the basis of politics as much as of literature or thinking.&rdquo; It is this struggle, what he calls his &ldquo;solitary-solidary struggle,&rdquo; deeply committed, deeply political, yet situated outside any ideological system, a struggle toward the construction of an ethics able to equal the complexities of our world, that has been his compass. The rest is poetry.</p>
