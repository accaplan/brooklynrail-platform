<p>No matter your point of origin, getting to Bemelmans Bar takes a considerable amount of travel&#151;roughly seventy years into the past. Thankfully the golden revolving door of the Carlyle Hotel is a kind of time machine, spinning you into its Art Deco lobby, resplendent with a sparkling showcase of &ldquo;Estate Fine Jewelry.&rdquo; Ask for directions. The concierge will point you towards a host, who informs you that Bemelmans&rsquo;s twenty-five-dollar per person table fee doesn&rsquo;t apply to customers sitting before 9:30 p.m. <em>Mazel tov!</em></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re settled, the Upper East Side piano bar is terribly enchanting. 24-karat gold leaf coats the ceiling, bathing candlelit couples and casual professionals in a patina of cinematic wealth. On a recent Thursday, house pianist Chris Gillespie crooned on a Yamaha grand, and lyricism emanated from the walls, painted by the creator of the children&rsquo;s book series <em>Madeline, </em>Ludwig Bemelmans. Titled <em>Central Park</em> and completed in 1947, the bespectacled elephants and tuxedoed rabbits envelop the space with mirth, an antidote to white-jacket waiters serving Osetra caviar for 235 dollars per ounce. </p>
<p>As much as this is a bar in New York, it&rsquo;s a bar about New York. It&rsquo;s where Sofia Coppola filmed Bill Murray singing &ldquo;Baby It&rsquo;s Cold Outside&rdquo; for his Netflix special, <em>A Very Murray Christmas</em>. And where Carrie Bradshaw, in the <em>Sex and the City </em>movie, advises her assistant: &ldquo;Enjoy yourself&#151;that&rsquo;s what your twenties are for. Your thirties are to learn the lessons. And your forties are to pay for the drinks!&rdquo; &rsquo;Cause honey, they&rsquo;re not cheap. Classics, like a twenty-one-dollar dirty Plymouth martini, come delivered with militant efficiency, its price tag softened by a sidecar wading in a small chiller. It&rsquo;s perfectly satisfying. A detour into specialty cocktails, especially the La Poire and Ginger, tasted like spring break: refreshingly sweet, and half the actual price. </p>
<p>But no one said time travel was cheap. Seven decades back and four cocktails later, the check was delivered, including the unexpected twenty-five-dollar fee. The host was summoned. &ldquo;So you thought you could just sit for three hours?&rdquo; he said, not really asking, so much as declaring, in the words of Madeline: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is, there isn&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo; </p>
