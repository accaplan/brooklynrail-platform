title: from 88 Dreams

<p align=center>1.</p>
<p align=center>An immense moon, whose whitish decaying matter is thickly strewn with volcanoes,
was quite close to me, surrounded by an absolute darkness. The lower edge of the sphere leaned against my work table. </p>
<p align=center>2. </p>
<p align=center>The room was full of unmoving animals who awaited an unknown signal to come to life and fall on me; especially serpents and beings that resembeld wicker sticks. </p>
<p align=center>3. </p>
<p align=center>Nativity figures had an ordinary shape and were arranged in their traditional places, however, they were immensely distant from each other. </p>
<p align=center>4. </p>
<p align=center>The &#147;woman from Paris&#148; came out of the
darkness and approached me. She was naked and her body was of of grey clay, viscous and wet. Nevertheless, I was not repulsed but instead I felt a great happiness to be there, next to her. </p>
<p align=center>5. </p>
<p align=center>I was tossing logs into the bonfire and, when falling into the flames, they were transformed into birds. From far away and surrounding me rose a magnificent rampart, circumventing the entire horizon. </p>
<p align=center>6. </p>
<p align=center>In a river, with water up to her knees, there was a naked woman, of white flesh and large harmonious limbs. Several crocodiles swam nearby. Finally, standing up on its hind legs,
one of them embraced her. </p>
<p align=center>7. </p>
<p align=center>I kill off many enemies, always fighting with
two swords, one in each hand. </p>
<p align=center>8. .</p>
<p align=center>Upon arriving in the city of ice, built amidst the peaks, I felt wholeheartedly happy; a great serenity took hold and made me unconscious. I watched as my hands became pieces of
crystalline water. </p>
<p align=center>9. </p>
<p align=center>He was forced by Mar&iacute;a del Carmen to live under swamp water. As it lacked depth, he had to move forward lying on his belly and, only from time to time, could he take his head out
of the mud to breathe. </p>
<p align=center>10. </p>
<p align=center>The convict is taken to the place of torture,
kept in leg irons and dragged by a horse; although the animal does not move very rapidly, this forces him to perform many swift movements while walking, to prevent from falling to the ground. The device that will put him to death is a crane which feeds on living flesh.
Its metal has a sort of reddish vibration. </p>
<p align=center>11. </p>
<p align=center>There is a big gray chamber, illuminated by an open door, from which smoke pours out.  The walls contain signs from the Hebrew alphabet. </p>
<p align=center>12. </p>
<p align=center>I was heading for a great landscape of calcareous contexture in the dead of night, and with some dry olive branches I beat my own hip to turn myself into her. </p>
<p align=center>13.</p>
<p align=center>At the end of the corridor, as soon illuminated
as in the dark, there was a clown smiling at me. </p>
<p align=center>14. </p>
<p align=center>I had my chest opened by a large wound and precious gems flourished in the lacerated flesh. I was stretched out on a desk covered with a white tablecloth. There was no other piece of furniture in the room, and the dirty flaking walls saddened me more than my own wound. </p>
<p align=center>15.</p>
<p align=center>One could barely see through the vibrating atmosphere. On one end of the horizon, there was a pale and trembling sun; at the opposite end, the moon appeared. I extended my arms
to orient myself and could go into town, but it no longer existed. </p>
<p align=center>16. </p>
<p align=center>In the church, the images of saints are not on the altar, but rather on the floor in disorder. </p>
 <p align=center>17. </p>
<p align=center>She is sitting beside a window that almost takes up the entire wall. She is dressed like a bride and her white gown is stained with a few drops of my blood. </p>
<p align=center> 18.</p>
<p align=center>Towards the terrace where I find myself, the stars go down as spheres in various violent colors, setting against the intensely dark sky. Bolts of lightning strike in the distance, but I feel an immense sweetness, because I am thus living with celestial objects. </p>
 <p align=center>19. </p>
<p align=center>Secluded beaches, bristled with black masts, with posts that look as though they were made of burned wood. </p>
<p align=center>20. </p>
<p align=center>The dreams in which, obviously, I am in danger, as I find myself under imposing and crystalline bodies of water&#151;large rivers, a sea&#151;give me joy. </p>
<p align=center>21. </p>
<p align=center>I see an organ as high as a mountain. Then I go to the cathedral and as I open the door, I see that it is full of lions which roam through the nave, the altar and the high pulpits. </p>
<p align=center> 22. </p>
<p align=center>Sometimes I am a Christian thrown to the beasts; at other times, a spectator who, from the circus bleachers, contemplates the spectacle. </p>
<p align=center> 23. </p>
<p align=center>A city slowly melts away as if it were consumed by an invisible fire. </p>
 <p align=center>24. </p>
<p align=center>In the main square of a town they celebrate something like a bullfight. But it consists of the following: a girl torments a bull that is incapable of defending itself, and she slices off its skin
in large strips, rips out its tongue and gouges out its eyes. </p>
<p align=center>25. </p>
<p align=center>When one places their hands on the table, great symphonies are heard. </p>
<p align=center>26. </p>
<p align=center>From the pockets of my jackets, left throughout the house, hung on the back of the chairs, scattered all over the ground, stuck in the closet whose doors only open halfway, a multitude of strange objects that I cannot fully recognize comes out; some of them appear to be bird feathers, others are like crumpled and burned papers. </p>
