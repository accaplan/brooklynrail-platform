<p><em>THE DUMB LAMB</em></p>
<p>I sing of what I see. dumb lamb twirls<br>O on everlasting spit shaved to mouth<br>some dollars&rsquo; worth<br>worlds to gum dust from squares in<br>
array. Wealth and ice<br>and eyes on a tray. Long, long ago<br>I would have killed these people so bad.<br> The near ice only shines through its sluice heaven. <br> A fenced yard<br> allied with white sauce, hot sauce, salad, fries,<br>washed down with a coke to the vitals,<br>seeing its own broke law gummed and<br>accounted for little. A lick on the baby<br>smiles, choir nearby numbing. O dumb lamb leering<br>while the poem hands crumbly to pay hands.</p>

<p><em>LITTLE STATIONS</em></p>
<p>at night with water they wash down the stations<br>sweep the empty gloves<br>away from the tracks</p> 
<p>the stations glisten &mdash;<br>holes in the knees and jobs<br> returned as math</p>
<p>applied to applause<br>stay and touch shoulders<br> where no one can see</p>
<p>thank you MTA sanitation workers<br>thank you hours empty of<br>common traffic and commerce</p>
<p>it's our given to mind<br>ways to walk away just<br>to be and to love</p>

<p><em>TWINKLE</em></p>
<p>The arrested not yet is not yet happening<br>but really forcing it forward against its will<br>you are all in this room you are not yet<br>and all I can think is the void needs something to hinge it<br>tinder kindly singing<br> all of you friends if this mouth can say you<br>those other ways of living go by<br> novelty twinkles, singes, swings, hinges<br>not yet tender or worn as the edge of a photograph<br> and all I can think is I am missing them<br> in the reflection in the window of the bare white walls<br>but really forcing it forward against its will<br> kindly simmering lentils in a pan<br>you friends of a mouth, all of you<br> those other ways of living go by<br> not yet visible outside the window<br>their tides move against the swimmers<br>to sing of tiring, to tire of singing<br>to sip seltzer from a glass in Emily&rsquo;s apartment<br>all in this room you are not yet missing</p>

<p><em>ANIMALS FOR JAN</em></p> 
<p>Have you forgotten<br>what we were like then<br>indeterminate spaces<br>in tiling, in brickwork</p>
<p>numerical equations<br> anticipating purely<br> mineral states</p>
<p>we made larval<br>decisions and no<br>one we knew then<br>was dead or would be</p>
<p>little animals came<br>out of the soil<br>reciting the names<br>for each day</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want<br>to be different<br>then o you<br> were the best of<br> all my days</p>

<p><em>ONE DUSK OVERTURE</em></p>
<p>a yellow falling golden on<br> the blank facade<br>the blank facade is overcome<br> with its blank facade its<br> thought<br> is going towards the night with bunches<br> of hands in flowery vents<br>the trains put out toward milked<br> towns interruptable &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the elements<br>element fawning towns<br>where grass is lift to<br> instruments<br>to warn<br> 
the tides<br> of this</p>
<p>see there the past is tinting into this one unbearably irreducible dusk as dusk a form or shape thought fungible from eve to eve some dull platonic rotation of orbs abound orbs their lights reflecting colors shifting held themselves in and by grave inert balance circles around which orbs arrayed in circles circle think</p> 
<p>of a circle</p>
<p>in the bluing sky</p>
