title: Luminist Paintings at the National Gallery

<p>Slowly the nineteenth century is turning into dusk<br>  on Plum Island River and the Newbury marshes<br>  where thunderstorms gather over Narragansett Bay<br>  and the Boston wharves are tipped in flame.<br>  Here is an exalted dwindling light going down<br>  forever at Half Way Rock off the Marblehead shore,<br>  at Norman&rsquo;s Woe and Camel&rsquo;s Hump, Vermont, <br>  on the western ledge of Brace&rsquo;s Rock.</p><p>I suppose there is something strained <br>  and oracular in these incandescent vistas<br>  and glowing atmospherics, these salt rivers<br>  and seashores masquerading as the letter S<br>  (<em>The Sun, Serene, Sinks into the Slumberous Sea</em>),<br>  the tides of Time rendered in magentas<br>  and mauves, fiery violets and sharp new pangs<br>  of red for rainy seasons in the tropics. </p><p>What is luminism but silence at Tongue Mountain,<br>  a beacon shining off Mt. Desert Island,<br>  reflections on Mirror Lake? It is melodramatic <br>  coasts and marshlands, bleeding hillsides<br>  and a dark radiance staining the canvas.<br>  It is not light but a painting of light,<br>  an exhibition of the body of light, a suffused<br>  celestial presence, a void of wind and sea.</p><p>How far can our famous innocence carry us?<br>  We are like torches at nightfall flaring up<br>  and burning out under a streaked, transparent glass.</p><p>Crossing a bar common for the thousandth time<br>  in snow puddles, at dusk, under a clouded sky,<br>  Emerson said, &ldquo;I have enjoyed a perfect<br>  exhilaration.&nbsp; I am glad to the brink of fear.&rdquo;<br>  I suppose there is always something suspect</p><p>and na&iuml;ve in American raids on grandeur,<br>  and yet I like these local negotiations<br>  between day and night, water, shore, and sky,<br>  space and time.&nbsp; I like these intimate atoms<br>  of color&#151;cool, palpable, planar&#151;that make me<br>  think of towering bells in autumn<br>  and organs booming in hometown churches,<br>  schooners at evening lumbering across the bay.</p>
