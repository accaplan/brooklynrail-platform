<p>My parents only argue about important things like which way to sharpen a knife every time a Sunday roast is carved.</p>

<!--insert first image here-->


<p>&ldquo;You hold the knife and move the steel against the edge of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you hold the steel and drag the knife blade along it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When my father comes home from his car dealership, we hear him holler, &ldquo;This house looks like a pig sty. Children&rsquo;s dirty finger marks all over the place, every wall, every cabinet.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;And your tools are outside rusting,&rdquo; my mother shoots back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your friends are phony intellectual snobs.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours are crooks.&rdquo; </p>

<p>We were a very happy family.</p>

<p>At the dinner table, he tells my sister, &ldquo;Your table manners are disgusting. Why can&rsquo;t you be like your older sister? She has excellent manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are favoring Dorin!&rdquo; my mother cries in jealousy and rage.</p>

<p>My sister cries. My mother grips her fork and stares at him. I look down at my plate. My father has a satisfied look on his face.</p>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s ancient cocker spaniel wanders into the kitchen. My father looks at me, pretends to kick her in the ribs and laughs. </p>

<p>He asks if I want to see my cat dance. He cuts squares of wax paper and attaches them to the cat&rsquo;s paws with rubber bands. The cat tries to shake them off. My father roars. </p>
