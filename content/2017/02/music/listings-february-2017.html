<ul>
<li>February 7 - 12: Kris Davis residency at the <a href="http://thestonenyc.com/calendar.php?month=1">Stone</a>. Davis comes to the Stone on the heels of her latest release, <em>Duopoly</em>. In keeping with that record&#146;s theme, each night will feature a new duet, with Davis on piano alongside the likes of Jen Shyu, Michael Formanek, Julian Lage, Johnathan Blake, and Ingrid Laubrock. The exception is the Tuesday, January 7 show, when the Kris Davis Trio&#151;Davis joined by Stephan Crump on bass and Eric McPherson on drums&#151;will perform.</li><br />
<li>February 9: Noah Haidu at <a href="http://www.birdlandjazz.com">Birdland</a>. Pianist and composer Haidu is releasing his third album, <em>Infinite Distances</em> on Cellar Live Records, February 15. While we at the <em>Rail</em> tend towards the margins, this album is one of the strongest, most satisfying examples of straight-ahead modern jazz making we&#8217;ve heard in the past year. Catch a preview of this swinging, incandescent, smart music, then bring home the disc.<p><iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/283999195&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 11: Loren Connors, Isobel Sollenberger, and Steve Dalachinsky at <a href="http://issueprojectroom.org/event/loren-connors-isobel-sollenberger-steve-dalachinsky">ISSUE Project Room</a>. An evening of sonic addition: sui generis experimental guitarist Loren Connors starts off the night with a solo set. He&#146;ll then be joined in duet by Bardo Pond&#146;s Isobel Sollenberger on flute. Finally, the <em>Rail&#146;s</em> own Steve Dalachinsky completes the trio for a closing set blending music and poetry.</li><br />
<li>February 10, 16 &amp; 22 - 23: <a href="http&quot;//jazzgallery.org">The Jazz Gallery</a>: The Jazz Gallery is already one of the places where on any given night you can catch the best jazz musicians around. These three gigs are particularly special: David Virelles is becoming one of the most creative musicians on the scene, right before our very eyes; Ches Smith/Craig Taborn/Mat Maneri produced <em>The Bell</em>, one of the finest recordings of jazz and improvised music in 2016; and the two night stand of Henry Threadgill, Vijay Iyer, and Daphnis Prieto is a major event.</li><br />
<li>February 18: Harriet Tubman at the <a href="http://www.thestonenyc.com">Stone</a>. No, that Harriet Tubman; the trio of guitarist Brandon Ross, bassist Melvin Gibbs, and drummer J.T. Lewis. Their upcoming release, <em>Araminta</em> (February 24, Sunnyside), has been delivering a much-needed ass-kicking this winter through the cans and the stereo speaker. Muscle, clear-eyes, and finely directed fury can&#8217;t lose, especially when trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and vocalist Alicia Hall Moran are up front.<p><iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/7148873&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 20: Lasse Marhaug and C. Spencer Yeh at <a href="https://www.swissinstitute.net/event/concert-lasse-marhaug-c-spencer-yeh/">Swiss Institute Contemporary Art</a>. Prolific Norwegian musician Lasse Marhaug&#151;a stalwart of the Norwegian noise and experimental scene, his many collaborations include work with Okkyung Lee, Paal Nilsson-Love, and Sunn O)))&#151;joins Brooklyn&#146;s C. Spencer Yeh, a stalwart in his own right, and no stranger to experimentation, at the Swiss Institute. Expect an evening of sound straining at the bounds of the comprehensible.<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=80018556/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://marhaug.bandcamp.com/album/the-quiet-north">The Quiet North by Lasse Marhaug</a></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 23 - 26: The Music of Dexter Gordon: A Celebration, at <a href="http://www.jazz.org/dizzys/">JALC&#8217;s Dizzy&#8217;s Club Coca-Cola</a>. Long, Tall Dexter was the epitome of the artistry of the modern jazz musician: swinging, lyrical, witty, hip. An unlikely movie star, he was much loved and irreplaceable. This tribute will off music from his unforgettable <em>Homecoming</em> and <em>Sophisticated Giant</em> albums; the first two nights will be anchored by drummer Louis Hayes, who played on <em>Homecoming</em>, while the second half of the gig has drummer Eric McPherson in the band, that will feature tenor player Abraham Burton, and trumpeter Josh Evans. Here&#8217;s an example, with different musicians, of the Dexter&#8217;s enduring legacy: <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdujqxIbr4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 23 - 25: The Necks 30th Anniversary at <a href="http://issueprojectroom.org/event/necks-30th-anniversary-timeline">ISSUE Project Room:</a>. Australia&#146;s the Necks celebrate their thirty-year anniversary with three consecutive evenings at ISSUE. The first performance, on Thursday the 23rd, will feature solo sets by each member&#151;Chris Abrahams, Lloyd Swanton, and Tony Buck&#151;and conclude with the band performing as a group. The show on Friday the 24th is billed as a &#147;standalone performance,&#148; and Saturday the 25th closes the run with a durational performance beginning at 4 p.m. and set to feature special guests.<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0uCGDCNKno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 24: Noura Mint Seymali with dj.henri at <a href="http://www.worldmusicinstitute.org/event/456d05fbb81f0969aea13f5cc8a88ef7">(le) poisson rouge</a>. The World Music Institute&#146;s ongoing Desert Blues series brings Mauritania&#146;s Noura Mint Seymali to (le) poisson rouge. Seymali&#146;s latest record <em>Arbina</em> opens with the title track, a driving groove wound around a scuzzy electric bass that sounds like either an egg or your brain frying on a desert rock. Seymali is a star in her home country and a master of the ardine, a 9-string harp traditionally played by women. dj.henri will spin records before the show.<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1939331711/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://noura-mint-seymali.bandcamp.com/album/arbina">Arbina by Noura Mint Seymali</a></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 25: For Bruce Langhorne at <a href="http://blankforms.org/events/for-bruce-langhorne">Brooklyn Music School</a>. Legendary session guitarist Bruce Langhorne has performed with the likes of Bob Dylan, Odetta, Joan Baez, and Richard and Mimi Baez Fari&ntilde;a&#151;his contributions to the latter&#146;s <em>Reflections in a Crystal Wind</em> are especially memorable. Tonight&#146;s show pays tribute to Langhorne, with performances by Dylan Aycock, Loren Connors, Steve Gunn, and more, and coincides with the release of <em>The Hired Hands: A Tribute to Bruce Langhorne</em> on Scissor Tail Records. All proceeds go to Langhorne.<p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=807726310/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://scissortail.bandcamp.com/album/the-hired-hands-a-tribute-to-bruce-langhorne">The Hired Hands: A Tribute to Bruce Langhorne by Various Artists</a></iframe></p></li><br />
<li>February 28 - March 5: Craig Taborn at the <a href="https://www.villagevanguard.com">Village Vanguard</a>. If you don&#8217;t catch Tabor earlier in the month at the Jazz Gallery, he&#8217;s got a week at the Vanguard, leading Chris Speed, Chris Lightcap, and Dave King. This ensemble is on his new ECM album, <em>Daylight Ghosts</em> (February 10), a layered and engrossing blend of abstraction and hip rhythms. Focussed and incisive on the record, the music will likely catch fire live.</li><br />
