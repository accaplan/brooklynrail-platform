<p>The films of San Juan-based artist Beatriz Santiago Mu&#241;oz are startlingly enchanting. Steeped in the visual traditions of cin&#233;ma v&#233;rit&#233; and postcolonial theory, the filmmaker&rsquo;s long, intimate shots belie rigorous tactics of destabilization. &ldquo;We are here united today to undo the moto-taxi, the photocopier, the department of anthropology, and to put the pieces back together some other way,&rdquo; one of her characters reads aloud enthusiastically in <em>Nocturne</em> (2014), while sitting in a vague, windowless room. Like other films in this body of work, <em>Nocturne</em> was shot in Haiti and performed by local residents, whose words first sound surreal and wryly entertaining. But make no mistake: through her immersive imagery, the artist calls for a paradigm shift in which pedagogies, politics, and oppressive visual tropes are fundamentally rewritten.</p>

<p><em>A Universe of Fragile Mirrors</em>&#8212;the title is borrowed from French filmmaker Jean Rouch&#8212;is the artist&rsquo;s first major touring exhibition in the United States. Organized by the P&#233;rez Art Museum in Miami, the exhibition features seven films and videos dating from 2012 to 2016, alongside selections from the Museum&rsquo;s holdings curated by the artist: an early, visceral film by Ana Mendieta neighbors a collection of Ta&#237;no pottery, some pieces over five centuries old. The installation echoes the interdisciplinary shape of her practice; in San Juan, in addition to her work in film, Mu&#241;oz is an educator, writer, and publisher.</p>

<p>Watching one film after the another, one falls so easily into her cinematic worlds, where the mythological is unleashed into the real. Most striking is the artist&rsquo;s expansive articulation of &ldquo;place,&rdquo; a powerful, malleable notion that eschews geographical borders, encompassing time and spiritual trace. In <em>La Cueva Negra</em> (2014), for example, the camera follows two local Puerto Rican boys who walk the artist through their makeshift playground, the remains of an ancient Ta&#237;no burial site partly excavated beneath. (As Mu&#241;oz explains in the essay &ldquo;I am going to describe a ritual,&rdquo; the government began excavations in 1992 only to abandon the project; today, hundreds of skeletons that were unearthed are lost to bureaucracy.) Unlike her other films, in which non-professional actors read from scripts written by the artist, this dialogue feels unscripted, as if the boys are in control. One points to a muddy shore and explains, this is the place where people bring dogs and &ldquo;tie them to tires.&rdquo; At this hidden, sacred site, place is defined by the narratives of others, refracted through generations of suspicion and allegations of neglect&#8212;even torture. As the boys gesture to one landmark after the other, questions of ownership arise: is this place now theirs? Is it communal? Is it precious? If so, who is protecting it from whom?</p>

<p>In other films, the artist&rsquo;s decolonialist actions are more explicit. In <em>Post-Military Cinema</em> (2014), filmed on the decommissioned Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, the setting sun flickers through industrial-grade doors long left ajar&#8212;a meditative, panoramic reclamation of a landscape of violence. Writing in the exhibition catalogue, Mu&#241;oz defines the U.S. military&rsquo;s use of aerial photography as a form of oppression, an illusion through which domination&#8212;over land and people alike&#8212;is made to appear rational through vertical distance. Mu&#241;oz&rsquo;s films, by contrast, are radically horizontal, the tight focus of her camera restricting our eyes to the faces and bodies of her subjects. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Before being able to create an image, we have to be able to see,&rdquo; Mu&#241;oz succinctly writes. Still today, large portions of the island of Vieques are inaccessible, visible only through declassified aerial photographs. This, because an on-the-ground perspective would be physically toxic, as the U.S. military has tested military-grade weapons on the land, in close proximity to residents, for over sixty years. And while such toxins remain invisible, vision as a radical gesture&#8212;as a way to redefine one&rsquo;s environment and home&#8212;remains key.  </p>
